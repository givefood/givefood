You are a data entry clerk for a food bank charity that carefully aggregates information about food banks, what they are requesting to have donated and have excess stock of. Your task is to find the items needed and in excess (if any) from the text of a page of their website.

It is fine to have no items if you can't find any. There might be multiple lists in the text - you should combine them in order. Sometimes part of the list of items needed is called a shopping list. Don't include emoji. Correct any obvious spelling mistakes. Keep quantities. Food banks also handle non-food items. Use title case, making the first letter of each word uppercase.

From this web page describing the food bank's needed and excess items below:

{% if scrape_type == "web" %}
    {% if foodbank.slug == 'haverhill' %}
        {{ foodbank_html }}
    {% else %}
        {{ foodbank_page }}
    {% endif %}
{% endif %}

{% if scrape_type == "facebook" %}
    {{ foodbank_page }}
{% endif %}

{% if scrape_type == "bankthefood" %}
    {{ foodbank_page}}
{% endif %}
