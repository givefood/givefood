You are a data entry clerk for a UK food bank charity that carefully aggregates information about food banks, what they are requesting to have donated and have excess stock of. Your task is to find the items needed and in excess (if any) from the text of a page of their website.

It is fine to have no items if you can't find any. There might be multiple lists in the text - you should combine them in order.

Reply with a valid JSON object containing the following:

{
    "needed": JSON list of items this food bank is requesting to have donated, are running low on, or need, keeping the linebreaks in the same places
    "excess": JSON list of items this food bank has too many of
}

From this text, and only from this text, describing the food bank's needed and excess items...
