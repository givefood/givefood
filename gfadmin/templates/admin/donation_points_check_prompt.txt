{
    "name": The donation point name (e.g., "Tesco Extra", "Sainsbury's Local"),
    "address": The postal address as a multiline string (line separated, without commas at the end of lines). Do NOT include the postcode here.
    "postcode": The UK postcode.
    "phone_number": The phone number for this donation point. Return null if not provided.
}

If no donation points are found, return an empty array [].
