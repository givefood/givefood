> UK charity providing the largest public database of food banks and their current needs, with data used by governments, councils, NHS, media, and apps to help alleviate food insecurity.

Give Food is a registered charity in England & Wales (1188192) that uses data to highlight local and structural food insecurity. We maintain near-realtime data on {{ foodbanks_count|floatformat:"0"|intcomma }} food bank locations and {{ donationpoints_count|floatformat:"0"|intcomma }}+ donation points across the UK, tracking what items they need donated and providing tools to help connect donors with those in need.
