Some donated food
Your generous donations of food and household consumables do make a difference. Please check that all food items are within their use by/best before date. For health & safety reasons, we cannot accept opened packs of food.
Our Donate Food page gives details of where food can be left for collection.
As an alternative, we welcome cash donations which are used to purchase, as required, additional fresh foods such as milk, bread, cheese, eggs, fruit and vegetables.
