I know what it is like to suddenly face unemployment, worry about keeping a roof over your head and paying the bills.  Those years were fraught with both personal and financial issues, and I understand what the workforce, their families and the wider local community are going through at this time. In my spare time I like to walk my 2 rescue dogs, DIY around the house and occasionally a round of golf.

The election is coming at a time of great concern and upheaval for the people of Aberavon and the surrounding area.  The closure of the blast furnaces at TATA Port Talbot is a heavy blow to the area, I support the unions plan to keep 1 blast furnace working until the completion of the electric arcs. 

If elected I would continue the fight to retain employment the area, working to attract as much funding to the area to bring in and retained an already skilled workforce.

I became interested in politics when I was studying for my O levels during the early years of the Thatcher government. In the 1983 general election I stood as the Liberal candidate in my school’s debate.

I only join the Liberal Democrats after I retired due to work and family commitments

The polices of the Conservatives in Westminster and Labour in the Senedd have been detrimental to this country’s economic future, and so far, I don’t believe a future Labour government in Westminster is the answer to this country’s needs.

I support whole heartedly my parties view on the following issues

Helping the cost of living - The party wants to help people with the cost of living and their energy bills by implementing a proper, one-off windfall tax on the super-profits of oil and gas producers and traders. Profits are essential for companies to exist and provide jobs for the workforce, but excessive profits at the expense of the hardworking people of this county who are struggling to cloth and feed their families makes my blood boil. We have seen far too many companies make record profits and enrich their shareholders.

Give everyone the right to see their GP within seven days, or 24 hours for urgent cases - The Lib Dems have pledged to deliver this by training, recruiting, and retaining more GPs and freeing up more of their time.

Increase school and college funding per pupil above the rate of inflation every year - The party also wants to install a mental health professional in every school and invest in new buildings to stop crumbling. We have seen an increase in mental health issues since lockdown,

Freeze rail fares and simplify ticketing on public transport - The party also wants to complete the electrification of Britain’s rail network.

Scrap Tory anti-immigration measures - The Lib Dems want to scrap the Conservatives’ hostile environment strategy and invest instead in officers, training, and technology to tackle smuggling, trafficking, and modern slavery.

Cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2045 - The climate crisis is addressed with a pledge to invest significantly in renewable power so that 80 per cent of the UK’s electricity is generated from renewables by 2030.

Introducing proportional representation - Having lost a referendum in 2011 on this issue, the Lib Dems are keen advocates for a change to the first past the post system. We have a multi party democracy but an election system rooted in the 19th century, we now need an election system that supports this and also keeps the elected MP in touch their constituents, that’s why we are proposing the single transferable vote.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/89373/af426184-ae10-4261-a0ef-2de503fc9125.png

I've lived in Aberdeen for 40 years and as well as being a city councillor, I'm an NHS manager. With my life and work experience, I'm well-placed to be a strong voice for Aberdeen North at Westminster.



Having worked in the NHS for almost 30 years, I've seen first hand how our public services are struggling. I believe that Labour must lead communities in campaigning against cuts and closures. We must set a new agenda and put forward a vision for a UK that is forward-looking, outward-looking and puts people first. I believe I have the energy and enthusiasm, the understanding of policy and the campaigning approach to make me an effective representative at Westminster for all the people of Aberdeen North.



The UK deserves better than the constitutional nitpicking of the SNP and the disastrous economic policies of the Conservatives. Labour must present them both with a robust challenge at the next General Election. I would relish the opportunity to take on that challenge and to be part of the change that both Scotland and the wider UK need.



It would be an honour if you were to lend me your vote.

These restrict which road and streets you can use. Whilst things do not affect the constituency at the moment they are in operation in Birmingham and Oxford.

I support Reform UK’s plan to stop the boats and will vote for the UK to leave the European Court of Human Rights and the European convention on human rights (ECHR) In order to control migration. Also the governments Rwanda plan is a waste of taxpayers money. Reform UK would take the illegal migrants straight back to France. Not Rwanda.

By keeping the income tax threshold at 12.5% many pensioners and more low paid  are being forced into the income tax bracket. Reform UK would raise the income tax threshold to 20% taking many of the poorly paid out of the need to pay the tax.

The Bank of England (BoE) pays individual banks interest on money they keep for quantitative easing (QE)  purposes. Reform UK would  instruct the (BoE) to stop paying this interest to individual banks saving  taxpayers approximately £35bn  per year.

Ian is a local teacher, the Head of History at St Francis of Assisi School, a secondary school right in the heart of Aldridge. He is well known to many local families from his years of teaching students from Aldridge and the surrounding area.

Ian has previously been a local councillor and candidate for Parliament in the neighbouring borough of Sandwell, and now lives with his family in Birmingham. As a teacher, Ian is passionately committed to seeing schools nurture young people. Education is vital to develop the life chances of young people, and Ian wants to see a well-funded education for all. He is all too aware that years of Conservative funding cuts mean that school budgets simply do not stretch far enough, and that only the Liberal Democrats, by creating a £17 billion infrastructure fund, part of which will go towards modernising our schools, are able to tackle this issue.

Ian is also committed to stopping Brexit. “Many of the students I teach have families that come from all over Europe”, he comments. “I want to build a better future for all my students, that has Britain at the heart of Europe, not outside it”. As an experienced local teacher, Ian is well aware of how concerned young people are about climate change. He knows that the Liberal Democrats are the only party with a clear and realistic plan to solve the climate crisis. Liberal Democrats are already committed to making all new homes zero carbon by 2021 and developing renewable energy sources – the policies that will ensure a future for our young people and our planet.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/54e7a5cf02f716934fefdb7b.png

Throughout that time we've had a Conservative MP in Amber Valley. The country is now crying out for change and with your help, I'll be part of a Labour government which delivers it.



I'm Linsey Farnsworth, Labour's parliamentary candidate for Amber Valley. Amber Valley is my home and I live here with my husband and teenage children. I'm not a career politician, so for me, the opportunity to become the MP for Amber Valley is about serving my community and helping the people within it. That's why I became a Borough Councillor representing the people in my own ward: Kilburn, Denby, Holbrook and Horsley.



I was a Crown Prosecutor for 21 years until recently stepping back to concentrate on Amber Valley. I've watched the Conservatives govern as if it were a game, and I know many people in Amber Valley are feeling disillusioned with politics and politicians. I firmly believe we need to bring decency back into politics. In the Crown Prosecution Service I served with openness, honesty and fairness and treated everyone with respect. I've since been appointed as the Chair of Standards in Amber Valley Borough Council, in charge of ensuring Councillors stick to the code of conduct and step in if they don't.



I'm proud of my working class background. Growing up my dad was a coal miner and when the pits closed he was out of work. Money was tight and so I know how it is for people in Amber Valley, struggling under the cost-of-living crisis of this Conservative government's making. Under a Labour government my dad was able to retrain as a bricklayer and get our family back on its feet. As part of the next Labour government I'll work hard to support people through this cost-of-living crisis.



My mum died of cancer in 1989, diagnosed too late because our NHS was overburdened under a Conservative government. My step-mum is a nurse and my dad, who has dementia, was in hospital recently. I've witnessed first hand the strain our NHS is under again. In Amber Valley people are struggling to get appointments to see their GP or accessing an NHS dentist. As our MP I'll make it a priority to change this and to get our NHS back on its feet.



As a Crown Prosecutor I worked to bring criminals to justice and helped to give victims a voice in court. Most recently I worked internationally in British Embassies tackling serious criminals including people smugglers, fraudsters and drug gangs. With this background I'll focus on making us safer, whether that's nationally, working in government to take down the people smuggling gangs bringing vulnerable people into the country on small boats, or locally, working with our Police and Crime Commissioner Nicolle Ndiweni to put more police on the streets to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour in our town centres.



As a mother of teenage children I'm keen to be part of a Labour government which will prioritise their education, to make sure they all have a chance to fulfil their potential and that will tackle the climate crisis so that there is a future for them to look forward to.

The corruption and refusal to do their jobs properly and lawfully, their lack of progress in so many areas from COVID19, to healthcare, from the economy to poverty and education to house building and the unwillingness to tackle the issues at the root cause.

 Briefly, I am looking to concentrate on the following: -

Revoke the Lockdown – repeal all Coronavirus acts  Educate for Life - Concentrate on STEM & Restore Education Standards Flat Rate Taxation - Simplify taxes across the board to one tax on final income/profit, raise personal tax base to exclude low income Overhaul Government for Transparency and Reduce Government functions to  a minimum  Rebuild the NHS – simplify the outputs of the NHS to the purpose of saving lives and treating illnesses and remove over management Maximize the Economy  – Grow the economy, encourage individuals, entrepreneurs and true SME companies, replace planning system

I spent much of my childhood in social housing, and laboured on building sites to help pay my way through law school. Following this I served as an officer in the Royal Navy, including on ships & submarines at Faslane. I really enjoyed visiting the amazing communities in the wider area. I then got a scholarship to an MBA and now I work for a Scottish asset manager.



Helping to guide me have been my mother, who was a teaching assistant, my father who was a journalist, and my wonderful wife and family.



I love Argyll, Bute and South Lochaber. It has a strong sense of identity and unique heritage. It's one of the most beautiful places on earth and it has a really positive culture. It has so much potential.



However, the evidence also shows that far too many constituents suffer from deprivation. Parts of our communities have poor levels of income, poor levels of employment, poor levels of health, poor levels of education, poor levels of crime, poor access to public services and poor levels of housing. After years of the Tories and SNP, we are clearly not fulfilling our potential.



There's been lots to feel gloomy about recently. But looking forward I'm excited.



I wish to convey my strong sense of aspiration to voters. I know Labour has a good plan to help our constituents, economy, and public services. I know Labour is the party that can deliver change.



I want to be a voice for everyone in Argyll, Bute and South Lochaber. I want to fight for our communities, for our public services, for our economy, and for our country. I want more growth and less inequality. I want a stronger public sector supported by a stronger and growing economy.



I've been doing lots of campaigning across Scotland. I'm struck by the strong desire for change. I see this election as our chance to deliver it.



Life has taught me that we can overcome challenges if we work together and invest for the future. If we do this, I'm sure we can deliver the change that our constituents and country need.

Steve McAuliffe is an ex-British Army Air Corps soldier whose 20-year career in ecology and environmental management consultancy has spanned both industry and politics. He represents Arundel & Walberton on Arun District Council, is a board member of South Downs National Park, and recently completed his Masters, focusing on protected species legislation and anthropogenic impact mitigation.

McAuliffe has already shown that he is a viable option for many Conservatives. In the last 15 months he has won two elections in the affluent and ‘safe’ Tory ward of Arundel & Walberton – the second of which secured a further two Green seats and a clean sweep.    

“I believe we have a chance of taking this constituency from the Conservatives for the first time in decades. Life-long Conservative voters have voted for Green candidates in unprecedented numbers at recent local elections,” says McAuliffe.   “Our current systems and policies are failing to secure a sustainable and affordable future for the people of Arundel & South Downs, our wildlife and the wider world. A green technology and infrastructure transition is viable, economically prudent and in all our best interests and I believe Green politics is in tune with the values and views of the majority of Arundel and South Downs constituents.”   

 McAuliffe has a solid track record of delivering on campaign promises demonstrating hard work and an ability to get things done. A key campaign pledge last May was to prevent the development of an Air BnB ‘party house’ in River Road, Arundel. By September McAuliffe got the plan scrapped following significant work to discredit the financial basis of the project, the erroneous income predictions and unrealistically optimistic build costs.   

Local party spokesperson Faye Mackenzie says: “I’m delighted Steve has been selected to represent communities across Arundel & South Downs in the much-anticipated election this year. Like the rest of the country, people in Arundel & South Downs are fed up of sewage, flooding, inappropriate development and the lack of investment in essential services like the NHS. Steve is the change candidate the people of Arundel & South Downs need as their representative in parliament.”",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/95444/39b4e1af-d6a5-4a7f-9481-372b31ce6638.png

At a time when the area is enjoying strong economic growth and the development of new education, transport and leisure facilities it is more important than ever that we have a strong and stable Government.

With the vital Brexit negotiations coming up every vote cast for Theresa May and the Conservatives will strengthen our hand. We have a one-off chance to hold an election while the EU agrees its negotiating position.

The choice on June 8th is a strong Government led by Theresa May, which I will be proud to support, or a weak and unstable coalition led by Jeremy Corbyn, propped up by Nicola Sturgeon and the Liberal Democrats.

I am a mental health nurse, who has worked in the NHS for the past 22 years, and is currently working as Head of Nursing, Quality and Patient Safety. I started my NHS career at the Arundel unit based in the William Harvey Hospital as a junior nurse. I have been able to undertake many academic qualifications whilst working in the frontline, the highest being a master's degree in Health Care Leadership.



My lived experiences in the NHS, interactions with the patients and families as well as educational opportunities have all contributed to developing a greater insight into the issues that matter most to the people. Consequently, a desire to develop practical solutions with collaboration and innovation has led me to this current political candidacy.



I am currently a borough councillor, representing Aylesford and East Stour Ward. I believe that the MP for Ashford should be visible and stand up for the community. Someone who should address the problems that matter to the people of Ashford such as improved access to GP, Dental and hospital services, pothole-free roads, revitalising the town centre and bringing back Ashford International.



I am a hardworking, motivated and resilient individual who goes above and beyond to achieve the goal that is set with a purpose, be it in my personal, professional or public life.

This area is my home and I care very much about what happens here.

I am an active member of the community – a member of our local Women’s Institute, and co-founder of Wombles of Willesborough, a community litter picking group.  I have spoken at many events and workshops, including for Ashford BME, Ashford Girl Guides and a several of our schools in the Borough.   I also work closely with and support our Kent County Council & Ashford Borough Council Councillors. 

I got into politics because quite frankly I’m angry.  I feel we have been consistently let down by successive governments who seem to care more about staying in power and keeping large corporations happy, than they do about residents and the planet.

I joined the Green Party in 2011 and have been a driving force in building our profile locally and getting more and more Greens elected.  Something I was told would never happen here.  I stood as your General Election candidate in the last three General Elections, and year by year more and more people are believing in us and voting for us.  We have a strong team and in the Borough of Ashford, we are in Joint Administration of the Ashford Borough Council, and also on Folkestone & Hythe District Council.  The Green Party is a strong presence in communities across the constituency.

I believe in a holistic approach. I believe we need to have joined up thinking, and I believe we need to have politicians who listen to residents and who vote with their conscience.

I’m a self-employed training consultant and coach and have a Master’s Degree in Forensic Psychology and Criminology. I have worked within both the public and private sectors and across a whole variety of industries.  Outside of work my passions are politics, animals and running (albeit very slowly).

The new boundary changes give us an exciting opportunity in the coming election to see real change. I want to see communities thrive, and the environment nurtured, and I am truly honoured to represent Ashford as its Green Party Parliamentary candidate once more.  

Please give me your support and back my campaign.  Thank you.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/5151/991f2014-a351-4d83-9f7f-a38adb8fe5d8.png

Individual voters have their own lives to lead, they may not have the time, interest or the information with which to see the best solution - a Councillor should to that job for them.,

My job as an elected Green representative would be to listen to the issues raised by all voters - not just for the Greens. I would see how they could be addressed in an environmentally sustainable and socially, multi culturally acceptable way. I may not have the answers myself but I will have the time and the support required to find the right people to ask. 

I would check the validity of the requests by establishing the level of support for them. It is not possible to give everyone everything they may want - simply because the desires may well contradict each other.  Also, it could be that I may be asked to do something that does not feel very ‘Green’. In that case I would dig deeper and see why the question was asked and find a better, greener way to address it - one that would not only be acceptable to everyone but also be possible to achieve. 

I do not believe that anything should be rejected on a matter of cost. There are many ways to get things done and some of them do not need financial support.

I'm committed to working hard and being honest about where I stand, prioritising residents and their concerns.

Fourteen years of Conservative government have brought huge cuts in funding to Barrow and Furness, leaving communities and town centres hollowed out and left behind, with an ever expanding gap of inequality. They now offer a small fraction of what should have been delivered over those years with ""levelling up"", forcing communities to battle each other for funds.

My drive in life is Community. I believe it's the bedrock of a lot of the best things in life and when we work together, we can achieve incredible things.

I've found that the links between my many roles, businesses, levels of government and community groups is the key to producing results. With a Labour MP and Labour government we can deliver. If elected, I will work to deliver the enormous potential we have here in Furness.

But they, and the public they serve, are being let down by the Conservatives.

The Conservatives have taken people in our county for granted for far too long, especially people living in rural areas who rarely see a police officer anymore.

We need a return to community-based policing where officers are visible and trusted so that residents feel safe in their towns and villages.

We need proper resources put into the dedicated rural crime unit so that farmers are given peace of mind.

We need to be working with local agencies and organisations to help tackle issues like anti social behaviour, and we need a youth investment fund to help develop youth services.

Cuts and mismanagements from the Conservative Party have resulted in our police force being left with a £16m black hole. 

This is an absolute disgrace and it will be local people and families who will be forced to pay the price for the Conservatives’ neglect of Cumbria’s police force. 

It’s time we did things differently.

As an accountant and a former finance director, if I was elected to be our next Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner on May 2nd, I would make sure that we get value for money, with a real focus on outcomes – preventing and detecting crime and ensuring that people in Cumbria are safe.

I originally involved myself in local politics as a way to lessen my own fears about what the future looked like. There’s an almost endless list of reasons for young people to have little faith that the future will get better, climate change being chief among them. My hope is that people locally will see my candidacy as a small step towards building a world that works for everyone, not just the fortunate few at the top.

I am a big believer in devolution, local people making decisions about local issues, which is why I’m focusing my campaign on the fact that I’m the only left-of-centre candidate with real ties to Basingstoke. I have lived here 7 years and have been involved in many community groups and activities for the entire time living here. Unfortunately for the people of Basingstoke, our options for the next election are limited to the incumbent, a Lib Dem from Oxford or a Labour candidate from London. I am the local choice.”

Outside of politics, Michael has been a magistrate since 2020, one of only a very few across the country under the age of 30. Michael has also held several volunteering roles, having been a local RSPCA trustee for 4 years, a school governor for a year and working with his wife who recently restarted the Chineham conservation group and now works with Natural Basingstoke to co-ordinate nature conservation efforts across the borough.

He is also currently pursuing a master’s degree in environmental science with the Open University. Michael said: “I believe that every person elected to office needs at least a basic understanding of climate science, but I'd like to go a step further and make sure that I can robustly defend against any climate sceptics that I might come across in the political world.”

“I'm not uniquely or overly qualified to be a politician, having never formally studied politics or economics, but I do believe there is one area in which I excel; relentlessly pursuing greener policies and securing a future for myself and other young people across the country and across the world. The last thing we need is more politicians with degrees in politics – if we’ve learnt anything as a country it’s that people who groom themselves to become MPs are the last people who should be doing it! I graduated from an apprenticeship, I’ve worked for the same company for 10 years, I’ve served my community and I’m ready to keep serving it with the same level of loyalty and relentlessness that has lead me to achieve all I have in my life.”",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/74083/cea76a91-99e8-4884-83ea-9243e7ccd83f.png

His mother and grandparents all worked in the NHS, and he has inherited their firm belief in the importance of strong public services.

Dan works in consulting, with a focus on community engagement – a role that involves helping those who are often shut out of the national planning process have their voices heard. Now he wants to help make your voice heard, building the relationship between Bath and Westminster so that we can work together to solve local problems.

In his spare time, Dan enjoys cycling. He is a qualified football referee, which allows him to travel the area and visit its community sports clubs.

Dan’s vision for Bath “Bath is a brilliant city with a great sense of community. People look out for each other here. But, like everywhere else in the UK, Bath has suffered under 14 years of chaotic Conservative government.

Our beloved RUH is facing the biggest challenges of its lifetime; air quality needs improving; local schools are desperately under-resourced; nursery spaces and dentist appointments are increasingly hard to get; highstreets have vacant units where independent businesses are struggling; and the cost-of-living crisis means people are increasingly concerned about their and their family’s future.

I became politically active after the Conservatives won a majority in the 2015 general election. I and many around me were bearing the brunt of cuts, and I could see people’s living standards and opportunities diminishing year-on-year, particularly for the younger generation. I’ve never been one to sit on the sidelines, so I started campaigning with the Labour Party. Now I want to represent Bath so I can stick up for interests of the residents here.”

A better future under Labour We are entitled to so much more this Conservative government has given us.

If elected, Dan will be ambitious for Bath – a strong, energetic voice on the issues that matter to you

He will work hard to ensure a focus on:

 - Genuinely affordable housing – so local people can stay in the city where they grew up

 - A real Living Wage and strong employment rights – so Bath no longer has so many low-wage, insecure jobs

 - An end to NHS backlogs, with more GP, dentist, and mental healthcare appointments

 - A reduction in energy bills – helping Bath homeowners and renters alike save up to £1,400 a year through Labour’s commitment to deliver cheaper, greener energy and retrofit properties

 - A local public transport system that works for residents and promoting active travel Support for Bath’s arts and creative industries, with a proper appreciation of their importance to our economy and our society

A brief introduction to who I am and how I got here.

The English side of my family has lived in Bath since the interwar years. Although I spent many summer holidays as a child in Bath, it was 1985 before I came to study and live long term. 

My studies culminated in a degree in Religious Studies and later a PGCE in Secondary Education. Most of my teaching happened in the inner city of Bristol, although I have experience of Bath schools as a supply teacher (Culverhey, St Mark and Hayesfield).

Both my sons still live in the city but I am one of the many who have become squeezed out for a number of reasons. 

Professionally, I have turned my hands to several ways of earning a living and have been self-employed for a much longer time that I was salaried. So, I have a wide experience of the world and know how to survive economically. 

My political career began when I won two landslide victories for two consecutive years as a classroom rep, age 14 and 15. Since then I have had a tendency of volunteering for unpleasant jobs that most shy away from. 

More recently, I became chocked with frustration at the state of affairs in this country and decided to do something about it. Yet again I volunteered, this time with Reform UK, who entrusted me with becoming Wiltshire Coordinator. A task I undertook with such enthusiasm that I was recently promoted to Sub Coordinator for the South West. 

I keenly watched as not one but two candidates applied for the PPC position in Bath only to see both stand down because of personal reasons. So, here I am! 

What Bath will get with me is an honest candidate, who actually loves the city and has both fond and clear memories over 6 decades of living here. I know the problems you face, nationally and locally. My dedication and hard work will show and I will do my best to never let you down. 

I have been around Bath long enough to say I have driven over Pultney Bridge!

Support me if you want representation that is beyond ideology, representation that will really take account of your needs and your opinions.

I'll be seeing you soon on the campaign and let's turn this city aqua blue!",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/115070/ef017468-469c-4ee5-93f3-ea3ec169d299.png

I work in the technology sector. I studied computer science at university and moved here to work for a rapidly growing start-up in Bath. I've worked in a number of Bath-based technology companies since.

I have a long-standing interest in politics which has only grown over time. I believe that most political parties have forgotten about what really matters - the ordinary people, the world we live in, and the quality of our lives. The wishes of the people are largely ignored by most politicians today. I decided that being elected was the best way to give people a voice and protect what we all care about.

I am appalled at what the Conservatives (and Liberal Democrats while in coalition) are doing to our NHS. This government has spent billions privatising it and handing huge chunks of it to their donors in private healthcare. 70% of NHS contracts now go to the private sector, against the wishes of the electorate. If nothing changes there will be no NHS left soon. However, I will not let it go without a fight. In November 2012 I was elected as a Governor of the Royal United Hospital in Bath. I promised to fight any and all privatisation. If elected, I will do the same in the council chamber. Universal, free healthcare, run as a service and not for profit, is not just fundamental to my beliefs but demonstrably the most efficient system. We must not let the profiteers take it from us.

Rights and institutions that have been fought for and hard-won by years of progressive politics are being eroded or destroyed. The poor and vulnerable are demonised, state help is being massively reduced, and millions are having to go to food banks simply to survive. At the same time, the wealthiest have seen that wealth vastly increase and their taxes reduced. Those losing out are being set against those who have even less. This is entirely unjust, unfair and immoral.

People are becoming disillusioned with politics and it’s not hard to see why - we see professional politicians flown-in to cities to fight elections as a step on a career ladder. I am a conviction politician - I want to do what is best for you - not what a party whip tells me to, and not what a rich donor commands.

I am standing for the Green Party as it is the only main party that is fighting for ordinary people. We don’t depend on corporate donations and I believe any party that does has a massive conflict of interest when it comes to deciding policy. My politics, and that of the party, are based on evidence, not lobbying and an unsustainable economic model - a world based on cooperation and democracy that would prioritise the many, not the few, and would not risk the planet’s future with environmental destruction and unsustainable consumption.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/49320.png

The cost of living crisis, compounded by years of Tory austerity and the devastating impacts of the pandemic, have resulted in an increasing number of people being pushed into poverty with many more struggling to get by.



I live in Bathgate where my husband and I have raised our family, with our three children attending local schools. Like most people, we depend on our NHS services including St John's Hospital and our local medical centre. The environment, transport and local services are all things that matter to me and my family in our everyday lives.



Since 2017, I've served as a Labour councillor for the Whitburn and Blackburn ward and as Depute Leader of West Lothian Council. I am passionate about fairness and social justice and have put these values front and centre of my work in local communities. Council budgets have seen real-term cuts from the SNP government over a number of years and front line services are struggling. It just doesn't have to be this way.



The people of Bathgate and Linlithgow, and the electorate across the UK, can choose a different future, with a UK Labour government and elected representatives that will put their needs first, ending the years of chaos and division we've seen under both the Tories and the SNP.

In 2024, we have a new Blairite Labour that has become the party furthest to the right. The Conservatives have proven themselves untrustworthy and more focused on themselves than the crucial tasks at hand. LibDems after 30 years are still getting nowhere, and the socialists have hijacked the Green Party.

Whilst some representatives of these parties may, in isolation, have some strong and noble ideas, the truth is that the aforementioned parties don’t have a clue how to provide sustainability. It appears they are too busy arguing with themselves rather than finding a cohesive or successful plan designed to generally improve people’s lives.

To have any chance of choosing a better future, you have to reject false promises, identify facts and determine what is real. I don’t know about you, but I am fed up sailing in this ship of fools. For the past 40 years, successive political parties have failed to create a fair or even happy country. All politicians are to blame but soon, in this election, you have a chance for a fresh start and a proper focus on the truth. So you don’t get fooled again.

Reforming opportunities in Britain by using Standards makes everything better.

1) Cost of living - Buying British, supporting food security, and choosing self-sufficiency in energy - solar, wind, water, etc.- reduce prices. Putting UK business first. 2) Access to services has been slashed due to the level of demand. NHS, utilities, insurance, and housing (air development) are available. So why don’t we put the elderly, women and children first? 3) Law and Order - We can stop violence, such as knife crime and theft, simply by having more police focused on catching criminals. Putting safety first. 4) Women’s rights – putting women first. Of course, there should be equality for everyone, but there should be no confusion that biological sex is respected in society, sports and clubs. 5) Migration should be managed, because more, means we are all poorer. Increasing the population makes us all poorer. The provision of public services has not improved. As a result, UK citizens, together with growing numbers of migrants, are all forced to struggle for the same GP appointments, NHS waiting lists, school places, reduced housing supply, and soaring prices. We had a stable population from 1968 to 1998, thirty years of increasing living standards. Why not just manage society, the environment, and economics to benefit the UK and its national interest? You know like we used to... This competition for services cannot continue, as it's is in no one’s interest and is caused by just too many people and insufficient utilities.

She has deep roots in the local community, having been raised in West Wickham and having lived off Copers Cope Road in Beckenham for 15 years with her partner and daughter, who attends a local state primary school.

Chloe-Jane chaired the largest Residents’ Association in Beckenham for many years. She has experience of working with Councillors and Council Officers on the delivery of local priorities. She has worked tirelessly to ensure that local planning and development applications are scrutinised, local heritage and green spaces are supported and protected and above all that residents' views are taken into account.

A champion of public services, Chloe-Jane led the local campaign to save the Blackfriars rail service from Beckenham Junction successfully in 2014 and now is campaigning for it to be reinstated by Southeastern.

Chloe-Jane is concerned about the amount of traffic congestion, rat-runs and speeding across the ward - our streets are not safe enough for our children and much more work is needed to improve our air quality, which causes more deaths than anywhere else in London.

Chloe-Jane is concerned about the lack of local investment in community services and infrastructure alongside significant developments. Bromley Council needs to better fund our local services. Only by genuinely consulting and listening to local people will the Council make good choices for our community.

Chloe-Jane would make an excellent Councillor for Copers Cope ward - she is committed, hard-working and cares deeply about her community.

She chose this area as her home because she loves its wonderful combination of history, vibrancy and culture.

Since settling in Bermondsey, Rachel has actively participated in various charitable projects. She has mentored young people, taught financial literacy and helped deliver food during the Covid pandemic. She is also a trustee of two charities that promote financial empowerment, and she provides emergency shelter to young people who are homeless.

Rachel decided to enter politics to combat the incompetence and many scandals which have plagued Westminster. She is committed to restoring trust and integrity in public life.

Rachel spent 16 years overseas, living and working in Japan, the USA and South Africa. In her professional work, she’s advised governments, families, businesses and charities on many matters, including job creation and land use. In May 2022, Rachel was elected as a councillor for our borough and is the Deputy Leader of the Southwark Liberal Democrat Council Group. 

Rachel is an experienced campaigner who believes we must prioritise safe, affordable and secure housing for all. She has campaigned on other issues including support for small businesses, period poverty and electoral reform. She has brought together groups from multiple London boroughs against the disruptive Oceandiva party boat and championed the environment by planting trees, campaigning against pollution in the Thames and tackling the blight of litter and fly-tipping.

Rachel is passionate about the environment and is at her happiest walking along the river or through cherished green spaces.

From a young age, seeing my father work as a doctor in Whitechapel and have his own GP practice, it instilled me with a sense of duty and compassion to help the vulnerable - a principle I always strive to reflect in my life.

Which led me to become a lawyer, to serve my community.

Throughout my career, I’ve earned international recognition for championing marginalised communities and fearlessly challenging the establishment.

My work includes:

Fighting for Shamima Begum’s right to return to the UK

Suing groups who wrongly label our community mosques and members as extremists or terrorists

Suing and bankrupting hateful figures like Tommy Robinson

Like many others, until last October I had lost faith in politics. The Labour Party's treatment of Lutfur Rahman, Jeremy Corbyn, and George Galloway over the years left a sour taste.

And our current MP, Rushanara Ali abstained from the ceasefire vote during a genocide, I couldn't stay silent.

I refuse to let self-serving politicians betray us by supporting atrocities in our name.

My mission is clear: I want to defeat Rushanara Ali in the General Election and give our community the representation it deserves

Our MP should represent us, but Rushanara Ali failed to do so, especially regarding Gaza. She's out of touch, never visiting her Bethnal Green office and barely responds to emails. She follows Keir Starmer blindly, ignoring your voice.

The last few years have deeply eroded public trust in our elected officials. Scandals, broken promises and partygate have been toxic to our democracy. I will endeavour to speak and act with honesty and integrity in all I do.

The current cost of living crisis is having a detrimental effect on people across the board. We want the state to commit to build housing on a large scale, nationalise transport and energy, and rebuild our country’s industry for the common good. These policies in the long term will reduce the cost of renting, reduce the cost of energy and place Britain on the best possible footing to bounce back from a decade of stagnation.

Unlike other parties we are not indifferent to what is made where and by whom. We stand against outsourcing our carbon emissions to other nations which have lower standards on pollution. Instead we want to ensure the UK is independent and resilient against global shocks by investing in manufacturing and building a green economy.

Along with material support for the NHS, we want to create a national care service to meet the needs of an ageing population and free up hospital capacity.

We want to implement a compassionate yet sensible approach to the refugee crisis which prioritises taking the most insecure people in refugee camps over those from Europe crossing illegally with the help of criminal gangs. 

The Social Democratic Party will fight for the common good in Britain’s national interest. We believe in a strong social sector whilst holding to traditional values. We believe in community, family and nation. I believe the role of parents should be respected by allowing them to have a greater level of input into their child’s education. 

The Social Democratic Party stands for free speech, free association and freedom of religion. We stand for democracy and will fight for a fairer system of elections that makes every vote count and allows people to vote for who they prefer rather than the least worst option.

I know this constituency well. From working in my parent’s shop in Sidley High Street as a kid, to running a B&B on Bexhill seafront with my late husband, Tony. This is my home and I am ready for the chance to show folks in Westminster what being from Bexhill and Battle is all about.

After 14 years of Conservative failures in government, many voters are considering voting Labour, some for the first time in a long time. 

Under Sir Keir Starmer’s leadership, the changed Labour Party is ready to govern and improve things for ordinary people. I am really proud to be standing for Labour at this election with a realistic and achieveable set of priorities that will make a difference to our communities across the Bexhill and Battle constituency. 

Labour can win here, all I need is your support. I promise I will not let you down.

My three priorities for Bexhill and Battle:

Better public services – from public transport and the NHS, to school and nursery provision. I will continue my proven track record of protecting, supporting and improving local public services.

Cleaner, cheaper energy – Renewable, community-led energy generation to bring down prices. I will advocate for our rural, coastal constituency to benefit from Labour’s new GB Energy company.

More jobs for local people – Quality, well-paid jobs to improve the local economy. I will encourage new industry to bring in new jobs, particularly for young people.

We know what that looks like because so many officers deliver outstanding policing day-in day-out. I want everyone who lives in Sussex to be able to expect that level of professionalism regardless of the colour of their skin, background, gender or orientation. 

  I’ll focus on preventing crime and violence, women’s and girls’ safety and I’ll support better funding for youth services while working to ensure we have excellent officers who are welcomed to the heart of every community and every home.

When officers are closely connected to the communities they serve we get a healthier policing culture, but when they’re cut off, as appears to have happened with elements of the Met in London, the opposite happens. We need to break down barriers and replace any sense of ‘them and us’ with a bigger us that brings police and residents together.

 I grew up and live in Ticehurst. I went to local state schools and read philosophy and theology at Oxford. As a journalist and former foreign correspondent I campaigned on issues including human rights, miscarriages of justice, the treatment of migrant workers and sex trafficking.

Stuart has been a Councillor for Oxton since 1997.

He works as an assessor for electrical apprentices.

Previously he has worked as an electrician in the local NHS and at Cammell Lairds.

Local health services have been brought to their knees, people’s mortgages and rent have skyrocketed and water companies have been allowed to pump their filthy sewage into our rivers and beaches. All this by a Conservative government more interested in fighting between themselves than standing up for the country.

This is your chance to vote for change. 

The long national nightmare comprising 4 failed Tory Prime Ministers and 9 years of chaos is coming to a close, this government has to go.

The more votes the Liberal Democrats achieve the more we can influence the future direction of the next Government.

My key priorities for Birkenhead are to -

Stop Sewage Dumping Water companies have pumped sewage into our rivers and seas more than 1 million times over the past three years – time to stop

Standing up for carers Carers – paid and unpaid, young and old – do a remarkable and important job. They deserve our support but are far too often forgotten and ignored. The recent PIP clawback demands should be written off

Ending Mental Health Injustice Mental ill health affects one in four of us. Liberal Democrats are fighting for a fair deal where mental and physical health are treated equally. We will prioritise early intervention to prevent people from experiencing a mental health crisis ; This means ensuring all young people can access support quickly.

Reform of the Regulators Ofwat have failed on protecting our rivers from sewage, Ofsted’s single word judgements are unsustainable, Ofgen’s failure to control energy bills has hit household budgets hard. All these regulators have failed and desperately need reform to protect consumers not protect shareholders.

Joining the single European market Restoring our links to trade with the Single European Market is essential to ensuring a prosperous trading economy, removing the unnecessary barriers to free trade will bring prices down.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/93-61b44924-061c-4888-9d38-8c631be77bea.png

We've been let down by 14 years of successive Conservative governments - crime and antisocial behaviour is rising, our public services have been decimated, and divisive and damaging rhetoric at the top level of government is the new normal.



It doesn't have to be that way. We can put an end to Conservative rule, and put the voice of Brummies at the heart of the next government. But to do that, I need your support. This is the most important election in a generation: make your vote count.

Progressing through secondary education, I pursued higher learning with vigour, culminating in the attainment of an LLB honours degree, followed by a master's degree.

Embarking on my professional journey, I dedicated two years to apprenticing at a prestigious law firm, honing my skills as a qualified solicitor. Subsequently, I undertook a pivotal role at Maurice Andrews Solicitors in 2014, initially offering my services pro bono as the firm approached its closure.

Through staunch dedication and demonstrable value, I earned the recognition of Mr. Andrews himself, who began compensating me on a commission basis for the clientele I brought in. This pivotal moment marked the trajectory towards my eventual ascension to Director of Maurice Andrews Solicitors in 2016.

Beyond the confines of legal practice, I have made significant strides in digital outreach, leveraging platforms like TikTok and Instagram to share educational content and cultivate a substantial online following. since 2021, I have accumulated followers in surplus of 350,000 accross various social media platforms and gain millions of view accross videos.

Personally, my greatest joys stem from my family life. Blessed with four beautiful children and a steadfastly supportive wife, our household is anchored by love and encouragement. As our children pursue their education in comprehensive schools, I am reminded of the importance of fostering a nurturing environment for their growth.

Rooted in a rich cultural background and driven by a deep-seated desire for success, my journey epitomises an unwavering commitment to self-sufficiency and entrepreneurial spirit, a legacy inherited from my father and embraced with fervour from an early age.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/111512/7b91ba27-3043-4d28-8ab0-da7e4ee97112.png

I'm a lecturer at a local university, a parent and a human rights campaigner. After 6 years of being a member of the Labour Party, I resigned because like so many others I felt betrayed by it.

As a Palestinian, I'm shocked and appalled that both Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer have justified war crimes against the people of Gaza. Steve McCabe, the ex-Labour MP for Selly Oak and the Chair of Labour Friends of Israel, has gone as far as justifying the bombing of children, women and hospitals in Gaza.

Under 14 years of Tory rule - a worsening housing crisis, a cost of living crisis and an energy crisis. Our NHS is underfunded and our schools are struggling too. Working people's wages do not cover rent, food and bills. T They had millions of pounds for ineffective PPE during the Covid-19 pandemic and to fund wars and genocide yet nothing for our welfare system. Instead of providing a real opposition, the Labour Party has abandoned so many of it's promises and cannot be trusted to support us.

I care deeply about the issues affecting the people of Selly Oak and that's why I've decided to stand as a Parliamentary Candidate for Selly Oak on the 4th July.



 Commitments:

Demand the immediate recognition of Palestine and support the ICC and ICJ accountability rulings.

Demand the building of social rent homes to fix the housing crisis and to

end homelessness.

Fight to save our NHS from privatisation and to pay staff what they deserve.

Support the scrapping of university tuition fees and bring back student grants.

Support calls for a 'wealth tax' to pay for our welfare system and public services.

I work in Research and Innovation at Durham University, my wife is a student midwife in the NHS, our kids go to local schools and colleges, and we're invested in the community.



I am standing to be our MP for the opportunity to serve and make a real difference for the people and place I love.



I admire people I meet every day who, despite being let down by a failing government, just get on with it: setting up businesses in a challenging economic climate, teaching in underfunded schools, treating patients in an understaffed NHS, and volunteering for neighbourhood clean-up teams, foodbanks, and youth clubs. But we are swimming against the current. After fourteen years of Tory government Britain is poorer, more unequal, and less influential in the world. We need a decade of national renewal to turn things around and MPs who serve the national interest, not their self-interest.



I've had a varied career in Business, Higher Education, and the Charity sectors. I studied Development Economics at Manchester University and have a strong interest in helping struggling economies to flourish -- including growing our local economy! I went on to specialise in conflict prevention and reconciliation, working in places affected by civil war, advising governments, charities, and the UN. So, my skills are in bringing people together to solve complex problems and build stronger communities.



I have also taught at school, college, and university levels, and I am passionate about helping our young people reach their potential, as I was helped in my teens by the policies of the last Labour government.



I don't come from money. My family struggled. I have been blessed with the opportunity of a great education but had to work 30-hour weeks on top of full-time study to pay my way through university. I have waited tables, stacked shelves, mopped floors, and laboured outside in all weathers. So, I know what it's like to support my family on low paid insecure work. Some of the people closest to me still do. I have fought my whole life, and I'll fight hard for everyone in our communities across Bishop Auckland, Crook, Shildon, and all the villages across Teesdale, and Weardale.

I'm closely associated with our struggle here on the Fylde, to stop the shale gas industry bringing the risky process of fracking to our community but am standing for so much more than this. Our governments have bailed out banks and enforced austerity - never considering bailing out healthcare, bailing out education, bailing out Britain. We see services cut in rural areas, leaving residents isolated with poor transportation, no libraries, no post office, no community. Our lives are not being enriched by government, they are burdened.

Lobbyists for industry are heard and aided, even when their plans put people at risk; something is clearly very wrong. This attitude permeates all sectors from our underfunded NHS to over-priced education, It is only by getting more Green MPs into Westminster that we can hold the government to account and build on the great work of Caroline Lucas.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/5202_huollhe.png

Chris lives in Blackpool South with his wife.

As the son of a Blackpool postman and teaching assistant, Chris has spent most of his adult life working in the public sector, following in their footsteps, most recently as the Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner for Lancashire.

As a leading voice in Blackpool's charity sector and a front-line public sector worker, he has a real track record of fighting for Blackpool's communities and continuing to put Labour values into action across Blackpool and has been awarded a Local Community Hero award for his charity work during the pandemic.

Chris has been fighting to eliminate child poverty in Blackpool for over a decade. He has been raising awareness, fundraising, and giving his time to help deliver 12,000 meals to local families each week through the food bank.

He's led the charge for improved mental health support for residents with the Blackpool Mental Health charity he helps lead as Chair of Trustees, which was awarded Blackpool Charity of the Year in June 2023.

When 800 local police officers were cut, as Deputy PCC, he launched new Police Task Forces to tackle local priorities, including drug dealing, anti-social behaviour, and burglary.

And when the Conservative MP for Blackpool South voted against free school meals, Chris stepped up and raised over £14,000 to ensure no child went hungry in the town that half term.

The next General Election will be the most important in a generation.

The foundations of our democracy and our way of life are under attack as never before.

Corruption is happening in plain sight.

Our rights and freedoms are being dismantled bit by bit.

The wealth we’ve created for this country over decades is being stolen from us.

Our living standards have flatlined for 14 years, poverty is rising. Where’s our money gone?

Only the Green Party is committed to returning Power to the People and resisting the forces which put Profit before People and the Planet.

Returning me, Richard Simpson, as your Member of Parliament will be your Act of Resistance. Your way of saying ‘Enough is Enough.’ A howl of protest against the selling off of our country without our consent.

Maureen spent her working life in a variety of roles and has worked in the private, public and voluntary sector.  She worked for a Solicitor, Building Society and Housebuilders before moving to a Credit Union and later working for North Tyneside Council.  She gave up her job in early 2020 to support in the office of the Blyth Valley MP and she also works part-time for 2 MPs.

The majority of her career has been spent in people facing roles and often supporting individuals and families through difficult or stressful situations such as moving home or for debt management.  During the time she worked for a Credit Union, Maureen supported those on low incomes to manage their finances and access savings and loan accounts.  She worked with individuals and families as well as delivering sessions to young parents, schools and training to community groups. 

Maureen married and raised a family in Blyth and understands the difficulties faced by working families around managing childcare and career.  She worked part time and served as a school governor and helped with reading in classes whilst her children were in First School.  She experienced the challenges of supporting a child with a learning disability through education and into employment and understands the issues and challenges faced by many parents throughout the education journey.

Maureen wants to see everyone reach their full potential and is a champion for social mobility.  She is passionate about supporting young people to achieve their goals and has supported efforts to improve youth work, education and training opportunities throughout the area.

Like many around her, Maureen became angry at the neglect of her home town over many decades and she vowed to do something to change this. She is delighted at the funding that has been obtained for the regeneration of Blyth and she continues to work closely with businesses owners to support them during the regeneration of the town.

Knowing the positive change a Labour government will bring to my community has been the inspiration behind the work I have been putting in both locally and nationally to make this happen.



I was born in Coventry, but moved to Canada as a child, coming back to complete GCSEs, then going on to university studying history, law and international development. I moved to the area when I became a Special Guardian to my two children, placed with me by social services. I knew they needed to be raised surrounded by a community that would encourage them to thrive. Being a Special Guardian and kinship carer has reinforced my belief in the need for change, for recognition of the realities of care work, who is carrying out this work and how it can be supported. Too many in our communities are left behind, doing the best they can to care for their families and those around them, but finding that ends don't meet all too often and the systems that are supposed to help are inaccessible.



My Mum is a nurse. I've watched her work hard in our NHS, committed to delivering the highest standard of care. Under the Conservatives this has become increasingly difficult, year after year having resources cut, no or extremely low pay rises and almost as importantly, the constant narrative of blame. I will be a strong advocate for the NHS, working for fair pay and conditions for staff and the highest level of care for all patients.



Bognor Regis and Littlehampton need good green jobs and investment that brings security to our communities. I want to understand and advocate for new technologies and consider new ways of managing our economy to ensure we prioritise wellbeing as a route to productivity.



My family and I used to live near the beach, something our children loved, but our beautiful beach was frequently unfit for bathing because of sewage pollution. We must hold the water companies to account, force investment and ensure there is enforcement of environmental standards.



Labour's commitment to halve violence against women and girls is inspiring. Underfunding of our justice system and the lack of understanding of the causes of this problem amongst Conservative policy makers are holding back progress in this crucial area. Gender based violence is an issue that negatively impacts everyone in our society and globally, I will work to meet this commitment.



In working to be elected in Bognor Regis and Littlehampton I will listen to constituent's concerns, understand your needs and work to bring about the positive change we need.

We are living at the beginning of a climate emergency  and this election should only be about the solutions to climate change as these will bring about a more equitable and fair society.

But the disruptors and destroyers of society are intent on spreading division by making this an election about Brexit. I am very happy with the Greens position on holding a second referendum and will campaign fiercely to remain.

I was born and bred in Sheffield and have working class roots, which I am proud of. It gave me a firm appreciation of the few things we have and taught me the value of a good honest day’s work and getting stuck in, since we had little other choice. There is definitely no silver spoon element here. Everything we have in life is what my wife and I have worked hard for and continue to do so to this day. I have an interest in history and read quite widely.

My early working years, between 1987 and 2004, were in finance. I worked for the Prudential Assurance Co, The Midland Bank/HSBC, and then two large accountancy practices in Sheffield servicing business clients. So while I do not claim to be an expert in any of these areas, I believe that those years gave me a decent look behind the scenes at how money works. I have an insight into the world of insurance, savings and investments, banking, accountancy, taxation and how businesses run in general.

This is not bad groundwork for any aspiring politician, I guess, and one that gives me perhaps more experience than someone who has just popped out of university with a degree in rocket science. From 2004, I have been running my own vintage motorcycle business. It’s a hobby gone mad for me and has been lots of fun. I have met some quite remarkable characters and learnt an awful lot about our automotive history. More importantly I have learnt from hard experience what it takes to survive in business.

Being self-employed means you have no sick pay, no holiday pay, no pension plan or cushy benefits such as a company car, medical insurance or an annual Christmas bonus. If you make a mistake in business, you pay for it yourself. This translates to being able to work hard all month and some months finding yourself worse off financially than when you started.

Have I had months where I‘ve lost money? Absolutely, and when you’re paying personally for waste or mistakes, you learn quick. When your own cash is on the line it is a fine master. It is something many employees never experience, and I feel do not perhaps fully appreciate.

Business has also shown me the harsh reality of red tape, of accounts to be done, of VAT returns to be completed, of health and safety, of rates, bills and local government interference, etc. Frankly, small businesses are deluged with hassle. Making a profit is the least of it sometimes.

So what have I seen during these last four decades working? Well, the 1987 stock market crash was up close and personal for me. I witnessed the Millennium bug scam unfold followed by the tech stock bubble bursting. I lived through the 2008 banking crises which triggered the recession and the ‘austerity years’ (have they finished?).

We all lived through the surreal lockdowns of the pandemic and most recently the cost-of-living crisis, where everything seems to have doubled in price regardless of reason. It has all been a remarkable financial roller coaster. Working to survive can be hard enough, but when outside forces collude to make all our lives so much harder, I’ve found myself gnashing my teeth in frustration with everyone else. Which brings me nicely to politics

Just like you, I’m sick and tired of powerlessly watching car-crash politics in the UK along with ambulance-chasing politicians who leap on the latest disaster to score some minor political point. I am tired of the weekly Punch and Judy show in Westminster where seemingly ‘detached from reality’ members score political points off each other across the dispatch box, while the world outside merrily goes to the dogs.

I am tired of hearing about (and more pertinently paying for) London's problems or the seeing the country's sole reliance on the one great industry... the city/banking, etc. I am tired of seeing all the other industries being left to whither on the vine. Fishing has been parleyed off, farming is on its knees, mining has gone, steel has gone, shipbuilding has gone, the automotive industry has been sold off or is a shadow of its former self – industry of all types has been actively run down. Even the utilities and trains have been flogged off and run into the ground. We are now apparently just a ‘service economy’.

Politically, we have had people shouting at each other across the dispatch box in Westminster since Oliver Cromwell established the place in 1650. I have to ask in all seriousness, where has it actually got us? The industrial revolution did not start in Westminster, nor the age of empire, nor the age of remarkable technologies, and even in terms of law-making... how much further on are we than the Magna Carta? All of these started outside the M25 in that strange wider world known as Great Britain, which is where I would like to focus.

It is time in my life to start giving a little back and I believe I can add a little value, for what it is worth. Like you, I am sick of not being listened too. I fall down the same potholes as you, pay the same taxes as you and struggle, like you, to survive. I am listening to your problems because I share them. Let’s focus on local issues and build jobs and a brighter future here together. What I am seeing and hearing from Reform UK tackles many of these issues. Their policies make sense to me. Common sense. 

I would be pleased to bring my years of experience to bear on our shared difficulties and listen to your problems. I have my feet on the ground and my head is most definitely not in the clouds. I know that all our lives can be made much better now and I want to pass on a far brighter future to our kids than we are presently on track to do.

I believe that it can be done and the choice to roll the dice and take that gamble will be yours come election day. You can choose the same old show or just maybe be brave and give the outsider a fighting chance for once. What have you got to lose? Another lost decade, or a real chance to start fixing the problems with a local representative you can relate too and is really listening.

This is who I am, and I invite you to back me to help Bolsover progress into the 2020s.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/115883/3896f647-c72d-4b6c-8541-50ada7377dc4.png

With a strong track record of campaigning and knocking on doors for the Labour Party, and a history of working on life-changing campaigns for different communities - from our Armed Forces to victims of press abuse - I've got the experience necessary to be Bolton's voice in Westminster. Every time I speak to someone from Bolton they tell me the same story about their pride in our town, and how it's a great place to make a life, but sadly they tell me that the reality is the town has gone downhill in recent years. Bolton is being let down and left behind under the Tories.

I know that Bolton has so much potential and opportunity, and I'm determined to work with our communities, businesses, and local services to make sure Bolton delivers for everyone.

It's time for a change. Let me know if you want to play your part and join the team - I'd love to hear from you.

This is part of the reason I am so passionate about helping my friends and neighbours make our community the best it can be.

I am a Liberal Democrat because one of their key values is that of empowering local communities. It's not about some faceless politician you've never seen making decisions about an area they may never have visited. I believe in helping people to help themselves so that the right support can be received in the right areas. 

Littering/fly tipping, crime and speeding are some of the key issues that residents have raised to me across the ward. 

Supporting residents with waste disposal is something I am keen to implement as a councillor for our area - I have several ideas around this which I would look to implement, one being a council approved additional waste collector scheme so that residents can have confidence that their waste is being collected and not fly tipped by the waste removal company.

I have personally experienced difficulties in contacting the local neighbourhood officers in relation to local crime issues and I would look to ensure a more open platform for communication with our local police neighbourhood teams. Working together will make the approach to policing more relevant and have a a more positive impact on the relationship between the police and our community.

It was with great sadness that I saw the speed watch scheme, set up by volunteers in the ward, dissolved due to a lack of support. As your local councillor, I would work to try and ensure there is support for such schemes from the police and council as this was such a positive example of local residents taking direct action to improve their own area.

This is just a taste of some of my thoughts on how I could support the community to improve our ward and if there is a specific issue you would like to know more on then please drop me a reply here or send me a message.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/34653.png

My Dad was a paramedic on Belmont Road, and my first job was working for the NHS at Bolton Hospital at a time when the last Labour government made record investment into our health service.

Yet after 14 wasted years, this government has eroded our public services, hollowed-out our town centres and widened inequalities.

It doesn't have to be like this. I have an ambitious, positive vision of a better Bolton West. One where power, wealth and opportunity are shared. Where everyone is able to realise their full potential, regardless of your background.

People across Bolton West deserve so much better. With a Labour MP and a Labour government, I know that together we can tackle the cost-of-living crisis, ensure investment in our towns, fix rising crime and the address the NHS backlog. That's why I want to carry on my family's tradition of public service in Bolton, as your MP.

If elected, I'll work with our local community groups, our councillors and with you to deliver on your priorities. And I'll ensure you have a powerful voice in Westminster.

I have seen the decline of our high streets and town centre. I have felt the pain of rising energy bills and food costs. NHS waiting times are at record highs, and people like my grandparents have struggled to access quality local social care. Sewage is being pumped into our rivers and seas at an alarming rate. And crime is on the rise. The next election could not be more important. After 13 years of the Conservatives, it's time for change.

I don't come from a political family, but I was taught to value hard work, honesty and public service. Throughout my career, I've worked with businesses, governments and charities to solve problems and get things done. I've campaign on early years education, fair taxation and cost of living support. Now I want to deliver the best deal for people in Bournemouth West.

I believe that together we can win a Labour MP in Bournemouth West for the first time ever - and work to make sure Bournemouth fulfils its potential. I want to see a Bournemouth that builds on its reputation for innovation and creativity, that protects its environment and ensures it is the best possible place to live, work and visit.

Together we can build a brighter future for Bournemouth.

Nearly half of women and over two-thirds of people aged 18-25 don’t feel safe in Essex after dark. Too many people feel they aren’t listened to when they report things to the police and that nothing gets investigated when they report thefts and vandalism.

I will push for Essex Police to tackle the crimes that affect people’s lives and work with partners to tackle the root causes of crime, such as insecure housing and poor support for our most vulnerable residents. As a Liberal Democrat I am campaigning to fund youth services properly so that we can work with young people to set them on the right path.

The Liberal Democrats have a track record of making Essex safer for women, such as the pioneering Women’s Safety Charter by Lib Dem-led Chelmsford City Council. I want the opportunity to build on initiatives like this.

Rural crime and community policing desperately need more attention. Only 0.1% of police in England and Wales are dedicated to rural crime teams. Essex’s team has only 11 officers which is simply not enough for our needs. Local communities across the county are crying out for more community-focused policing. I am committed to increasing the number of community-based officers, including appropriately trained officers for rural communities.

Our emergency services work hard to protect our lives and wellbeing but they simply aren’t given the resources they need. I will hold the Government to account, advocate for proper funding and give a voice to all Essex residents.

Vote Liberal Democrat on 2nd May 2024 for policing and fire services that work for everyone.

David Heather 

Independent Parliamentary Candidate for the Braintree Constituency.

Dear Braintree Constituent,  Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this. Your vote in the up and coming General Election counts. Why? Perhaps for the first time in modern history, the vast majority of people are utterly disillusioned with mainstream politics. Which means that your vote, if used correctly can change the status quo and change the people who govern this country.  

The first thing I should say is that if elected, I will not be taking a salary, instead donating it to local charities of your choice. I now run a small business which provides enough for me to live on without excess, and I believe others less fortunate can benefit.  I have had 40 years of experience in the real world from an assistant in a shop to Finance Director and Managing Director of large and small businesses both in the UK and overseas. I have over the past 6 months, since I decided to stand, listened to many people in the Constituency of Braintree. Many of you may have already had a chat with me, in cafes, pubs, shopping centres or supermarkets. What I have heard in the Constituency is both of concern and hope.  Local issues should always be at the heart of the Member of Parliament that represents you.

I pledge to always make myself available to you all to champion local problems and support local successes. I will support your concerns over excessive immigration. In our Constituency, Wethersfield Asylum camp highlights this problem. I will support an extremely robust approach on both legal and illegal immigration.  I will support measures to reduce the influence of small minorities on public and private life.  I would ensure that the Local Authority are charged with repairing potholes within 24 hours of them being reported and have mobile units travelling up and down all roads spotting and repairing without requiring permission.  I will support banning smart phones and social media for under 16 year olds during school time.  I will support our local NHS and private hospitals, looking for ways to integrate. I will campaign for a local Accident and Emergency facility in the constituency.  I will support our local rural communities, particularly farmers.  On net Zero, I will support a more gradual approach that takes into consideration the cost and benefit of measures put forward.  I would work with other Members to simplify our tax system and reduce taxes, to reduce the wastage in the National Health Service and to improve our defense of the Realm. I will also work to reform the Civil Service to ensure customer focus and reduce political influence at the heart of the Civil Service. 

I represent common sense. 

Democracy is about what the majority want, whilst listening to the views of minorities. It is not about minorities shouting loudly enough that their way is right, so it becomes right.  Thank you for taking the time to read this. If you agree with my Independent views and wish to vote for me then please do or you can ask any questions by emailing me at davidcnheather@hotmail.co.uk I have adopted the slogan BE CLEVER, VOTE HEATHER and you all, courtesy of the Electoral Commission be receiving a leaflet through the post. Please display it in your window and I will try and visit you so that you can put your points across to me personally. I will also be holding meetings in Braintree, Halstead, Wethersfield, Great Yeldham, Sible and Castle Hedingham and be in the town centres of the constituency over the next few weeks.

""I know what it is like to experience the anguish if parents having to choose between heating or eating, the uncertainty of not having a roof over your head, and the consequences of dangerous waiting lists and degradation of the NHS that we have seen during the last 14 years of Conservative misrule and economic mismanagement.

My mum was a school dinner lady and my dad was in the army. I went to local schools and then worked in health and social care. My great uncle Ken was one of the Shrewsbury 24, campaigning all his life for justice so Labour and Trade Union politics were part of everyday life in our house.

I became a Town Councillor in 2008, serving as the youngest Mayor of Brecon, and then was elected as a County Councillor in 2012. I've been re-elected at every election since, increasing my vote each time through my record of hard work. In 2022, I became the first Labour Deputy Leader of Powys Council, also serving as the Council's Armed Forces Champion. I'm proud of my record as an elected councillor, delivering a new Flying Start Centre in my community, the Real Living Wage for council staff and a new council house building programme.

Brecon, Radnor and Cwm Tawe is a fantastic area, and it's a real honour to be Labour candidate for my home constituency. For the last fourteen years our area has been let down by the UK Government, with families facing the biggest hit to living standards on record. Bad Tory choices have inflicted misery and a cost of living crisis. It's time for change.

At a young age, she worked on a market stall as well as helping out at her family-owned bakery before starting her adult career as a computer programmer/systems analyst.

Dawn’s desire to enter politics came from a deep-rooted commitment to address inequality and strong values imparted by her parents. She soon went on to work as an equality and race officer at the GMB union and an adviser to the Mayor of London.

Elected as the Member of Parliament for Brent South on 5 May 2005 Dawn’s maiden speech described her constituency as a “shining example of integration at its best”. Dawn later became the first elected African-Caribbean woman to become a Government Minister in the UK.

Dawn has always been a passionate campaigner for young people; she is an Honorary Vice President of the British Youth Council, was chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Youth Affairs and was made a member of the Children, Schools and Families select committee and Vice Chair of the Labour Party with responsibility for Youth. In 2008 she became an Assistant Whip in the Commons before her work on youth led to Dawn being appointed as the Minister for Young Citizens & Youth Engagement at the Cabinet Office by Gordon Brown.

Based in the Cabinet Office the Minister’s role was to coordinate government work to help young people engage with politics which involved working with ministers in relevant Government departments including the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) and the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and other relevant bodies.

The recommendations of the Youth Citizenship Commission report were published in June 2009 and sought ways to help increase young people’s participation in their local communities as well as in local and national politics.

After a short break from elected politics, in which Dawn spent time working as a Magistrate and public speaker, Dawn ran a successful campaign in the 2015 General Election and won Brent Central back off the Liberal Democrats, securing a majority of nearly 20,000 – representing the largest vote swing in Britain at that election. She was again successful in the 2017 General Election, winning 73.1% of the vote.

A natural campaigner, since returning to Parliament Dawn has taken on the ‘Big 6’ energy companies over the excessive cost of pre-payment meters. She has held a Westminster Hall debate, launched a national petition and secured a commitment from the Prime Minister to look at this issue.

Dawn continues to commit her time in parliament to representing groups and people in society that are often underrepresented. In 2017 Dawn became the first MP in its history to sign a question in the House of Commons using British Sign Language. Dawn used sign language in her question to highlight the need to give the language full legal status. Dawn continues to run successful campaigns on Employment Tribunal Fees and is now pushing for the Government to publish full equality impact assessments on their policies.

Dawn was named the “most promising feminist under 35” by New Statesman magazine and was honoured as MP of the year at the 2009 Women in Public Life Awards. Since returning to Parliament Dawn was awarded two Patchwork Foundation awards, having been voted People’s Choice 2016 Labour MP of the Year and next receiving the Overall MP of the Year award in 2017. In 2020 named one of the 25 most influential women in the UK by Vogue.

Dawn served as Labour’s Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities between 2017-2020.

It has been my privilege to represent the people of Brent Central as your MP since being elected in 2015. As Parliament has now been dissolved after the General Election was called I am now no longer a Member of Parliament. I am now standing as the Labour candidate for Brent East.

My office has dealt with over 47,000 constituents’ queries and problems, and I’ve taken issues important to the people of this area right to the top – as with the Pre-Pay Rip-off campaign that has helped save money every day for families using pre-pay meters. I was also thrilled to be voted Labour MP of the Year by the Patchwork Foundation this year and DIVA magazine “Ally of the Year”. This was in recognition of my work to make Parliament accessible to all, because I truly believe that Parliament is there to represent the people of this country and should be working in the interests of the many, not the few.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/1474/94f9ac55-cea1-4f4c-9733-e08f1154abb9.png

He migrated to the UK seven years ago, where he read law at university. After completing his training as a barrister, Bastôn was called to the Degree of the Utter Bar in 2023 by the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple. 

Before migrating to the UK, Bastôn worked for four years in the service industry and another four in education. Whilst reading for his law degree, he worked with asylum-seekers (who had exhausted all rights of appeal), assisting them in submitting fresh claims to the Home Office. Bastôn also worked as a policy researcher with the Environmental Law Foundation, investigating the state of affairs of Local Wildlife Sites and making policy recommendations to local authorities on how to improve these sites and cultivate a more cohesive ecosystem.  

Driven by social injustice and a desire to be more involved in the community, Bastôn joined the Green Party and was selected by his local party to stand in the 2022 local elections in Kenton.  As a Green Party member and if elected to parliament as an MP for Brent West, Bastôn will champion: •	a call for a poverty emergency  •	a ceasefire and recognition of a sovereign Palestine •	overhauling the disability welfare system to treat disabled people with dignity •	affordable housing & a charter to protect renters and •	food security

Bastôn believes there is presently not much difference between the two largest parties, which have moved from the original premise on which they were founded, resulting in a stagnation of long-term policies that affect society at large. As such, Bastôn strongly believes in the need to engage in honest conversations on the difficult decisions that need to be made to ensure we have a prosperous future for generations to come.

RJ grew up in South Essex and works in Brentwood. As a local Healthcare Professional with over a decade of frontline service, they know how vital our public services like the NHS are. They have seen firsthand the impact of years of underfunding these critical services have taken; a decline that has accelerated since the pandemic. 

RJ is a proactive member of the Green Party, contributing to the Party's Policy Development Groups on topics including Drug Reform, LGBTIQA+ rights, and Immigration and Asylum. RJ is an active volunteer in the Green Party's campaigning across South Essex, including taking a key role in the local election wins for the Greens in Southend-on-Sea. 

In their own time, RJ supports Essex's vibrant grassroots music scene; a lifelong love of music, literature, and art which began at Brentwood's Hermit Youth Club, a sorely missed local facility for our young people. 

Upon hearing the announcement of the General Election, RJ said:

""I'm looking forward to offering voters in Brentwood and Ongar a credible alternative to the old parties. People don't feel better off after the last fourteen years of Conservative mismanagement and they're looking for change. Our civic infrastructure is crumbling, vital local services are at breaking point, and our natural environment is facing an existential threat. The fact that so many of our frontline NHS workers are forced to use foodbanks to support their families should be a national shame. Everyone is shouldering the burden of the political choices made at Westminster, and it's about time those decisions took account of ordinary families' needs. For me, this is simply a question of fairness.

The Green Party offers a transformative and hopeful vision of what our country can be; a fairer and greener society, where people have financial and energy security, where people can lead happier and healthier lives in a good quality and affordable home, and where the reality of the climate emergency is given the urgent attention it needs. Greens across the country are already representing their communities and working honestly and collaboratively for the common good. We can have representatives who bring this kind of hard work and integrity back to public office, and this is what I offer. I want to put the urgent needs of our community back at the top of the agenda. If you share these values, I urge you to vote for and join the Green Party, and support our mission to build a fairer and greener country.""",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/50546/7d58d03e-d980-49c0-a27a-49f06ad2d18a.png

Career: For 38 years I taught in primary schools and specialist provision in Merthyr, Cardiff and Caerphilly. My additional roles included Forest School Practitioner, rugby coach and teaching children to grow fruit and vegetables. I also worked with children who were unable to attend school for a variety of reasons. 

Personal interests: I have campaigned to protect green spaces from ill- judged developments in Cardiff. More recently I have participated in regular  beach cleaning in Porthcawl. I volunteer in an ethical goods shop.

Recent life changes: I moved from Cardiff to Porthcawl,  having retired from teaching last year 

Political stance: I have been a member of the Green Party for years, and I am now in a position  to devote my time to focus on protecting what is important to me. Our schools  and our NHS are understaffed and in crisis. Our land, our food supplies and our waterways are in need of substantial attention  and investment. We must act now as a community to save our  planet for our future generations.

Bridgwater, Burnham and the surrounding villages have long been under represented in Westminster, I aim to change that.

I have worked hard as a local community champion & Councillor for more than 30 years in unions and councils.

I believe that Bridgwater with the surrounding towns and villages really is the beating heart of Somerset.

My parents worked hard to bring up 3 children. When my Dad passed away young, we were brought up by our Mum, at a time when the Tories were attacking single mums.

I lived through the 80's, through Thatcher's Britain. I grew up with a Tory Government that waged war on its own people.

All of this has made me the person I am: a fighter, a socialist, a diplomat, an effective campaigner for local people.

As leader of the Labour group on Somerset council, I have been able to work to make our voice heard, under my leadership Labour has impacted the residents of Somerset in a positive way.



My commitments to you if elected are:-

A HARD WORKING & APPROACHABLE MP. It will be my full time job.



BRIDGWATER, BURNHAM & SURROUNDING VILLAGES FIRST. I will bring people together to help our community thrive.



TAKING YOUR CONCERNS TO WESTMINSTER. Our voices need to be heard in parliament. I will make sure this happens.



Bridgwater needs an MP truly grounded in our community. We need a Bridgwater voice in Westminster not another voice of Westminster in Bridgwater.

Her impact has been phenomenal and support for her has only grown. People can see what a truly independent and strong representative can do, and I am working hard to earn each vote to prove that I can continue Caroline’s work.

From 2016 to 2024 I held the Labour Mayor to account in the London Assembly on the Transport, Housing, and Planning and Regeneration Committees. During this time, I was proud to strengthen the rights of renters, improve sustainable transport services, and help win much-needed new funding for youth services.

I was a councillor in Camden for 10 years and served two terms as co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales. These roles have combined to give me the experience to be an effective, independent MP.

I moved to London with an overdraft and a degree in 1997 and my previous, non-political work has been as a medical copywriter, PA, website manager, project manager for a digital start-up, author and transport campaigner.

Brighton deserves a powerful Green voice in Parliament, holding the next government to high account and championing the concerns of constituents.

He is a renowned campaigner, a Mercury Prize-winning musician and the elected Chair of the British Association of Songwriters, Composers & Authors (The Ivors Academy). A high-profile advocate, his campaigning has led a global conversation around rights and equity in his industry.



Tom joined the Labour Party aged 15 and studied politics in Leeds before his career in music took off. He has been a stalwart of grassroots party activism, organising and volunteering over the course of his life. He works closely with the Musicians Union on their campaigns alongside the organisation he leads. As a result, he is familiar to many in Westminster as a champion of music and the arts.



He founded the #BrokenRecord campaign in 2020. Garnering the support of over 200 of the country's greatest music-makers (Sir Paul McCartney and Kate Bush amongst them), he was successful in bringing about a UK parliamentary inquiry into the music industry. He coordinated a private members bill with Kevin Brennan MP, forced a CMA study and there is now a formal process with the British government to investigate industry interventions in which Tom is a lead negotiator. He considers the forgiveness of historic debt held against thousands of musicians to be his greatest campaigning achievement.



As a founding member of Gomez, he won the Mercury Prize in 1998. Still occasionally a working musician, he scored the first series of the BAFTA-winning 'In My Skin' for the BBC and is presently commissioned to write a stage adaptation of 'Danny the Champion of the World' for the Roald Dahl Story Company.



Tom also sits elected on the Council of PRS For Music, is a director of the umbrella organisation for the British music industry, UK Music, and has previously worked with the Helen Bamber Foundation Charity on their campaigns for victims of trafficking and torture.

The state of Bedminster High Street is unbelievable. The local Green councilors have let their area become a glorified building site by building ridiculous student housing developments. Considering there are numerous homeless people and families in the city; why are students top priority? These are only temporary residents and will bring little to local communities. Meanwhile, homeless families are in expensive, low-quality temporary accommodation with little to zero hope of getting a decent home. Crime is a key issue, especially with drugs, anti-social behaviour, shoplifting and knife-crime. A zero tolerance approach is needed. Policing needs to be back to basics on real crime. Drug dealers need to be punished, and more needs to be done for addicts to stop relapsing. People and businesses alike should not be living in fear. Harsher punishments for knife crime, and for those carrying a knife. Why take a life?  Public transport needs improving. Bus stops are needed, as there are areas cut off with huge distances for walking that's unfair on disabled and elderly people. Reliable services, which do not keep being cancelled as well as being affordable to people. Parsons Street and Bedminster railway stations to be bought into the 21st century with suitable access for the disabled and more regular services than a pathetic one an hour.

I am a pharmacist by profession and CEO of one of the most respected and biggest associations for independent pharmacies across England. As such, I know first-hand the challenges faced by our NHS colleagues and the wider healthcare system, and I am determined to help fix it.

I grew up in Finland and moved to the U.K. precisely 20 years ago to take up a role as a pharmacist. I fell in love with this country and became a UK citizen. I admire its progressive values, beauty, traditions, and people.

A single parent to 2 now adult children, her children went to local schools and she ran her own business from home when the children were growing up. She now works full time for a research company in the City of London.  

Julie is a well known community campaigner in Bromley.

    “During the first months of lockdown I set up two mutual aid groups for local residents, which coordinated offers of help to get it to those who needed it, especially those shielding on their own. There were literally hundreds of people who stepped up and offered to help their neighbours – our community is genuinely amazing, and one of the very many reasons I would be incredibly proud to be elected to represent it in May 2022.

    “I also organised socially distanced events to entertain children in my road when schools were closed as well as a socially distanced “marathon” that my whole street took part in as neighbours stood at the end of their driveways and cheered our new friends. The group raised over £4,000 for a local charity. The events attracted national press attention and were even, unexpectedly, featured on Sky and the BBC. I have been a regular volunteer at vaccination clinics since they started in December 2020.  “

A lifelong liberal Julie decided to join the Lib Dems and become politically active for the first time 6 years ago. She is concerned that the voice of liberal values is getting lost during these times when politics is becoming so polarised. Since joining the party she has become well known locally as an advocate for a fairer, greener and more caring society in Bromley. 

    “We have an amazing community here in Bromley – proved during the pandemic – and everyone needs a voice. I want to see a council that is community-led whose dealings are open and transparent, that keeps local people informed and consults with them properly about important local issues.”",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/8019.png

I grew up just over the border in Dunstable. My mum brought me up alone in a council flat, while she worked shifts in the Leighton Buzzard Morrisons.



Life wasn't always easy. Getting by on a low income, I watched my mum manage every paycheque to pay the rent and the bills, put food on the table, and give me as many opportunities as she could. Through her example, she passed on three simple values to me: hard work, aiming high, and never giving up.



Over the past year, I've seen first hand that those values are very much shared by local people, farmers, business owners, and civil society leaders across Buckingham, Bletchley, Tattenhoe, Winslow and the surrounding villages.



While people have hopes and aspirations for a better life for themselves, their families and their communities, they've told me they need a proactive MP who is on their side and can deliver change.



For over a decade, I've worked across the public, not-for-profit, and private sectors to shape economic policies that work for both ordinary working people and their families, and high-growth businesses in the industries of the future.



As your local MP, I'll use that experience to attract the investment, jobs and businesses which deliver higher incomes for local people, as well as fighting for the resources that gets the NHS back on its feet, ensures every child has the opportunity to thrive, and delivers clean energy.



We have a unique opportunity to reset the political conversation in our city, towns and villages. Please do get in touch. I'd love to hear your views about how we can build a better Buckingham and Bletchley together.

The party is over for the Conservatives. A Labour government with a big majority will need to be held to account. Now is the time for moderate Independents.

As a centrist ex-Tory I want to help restore the trust in politics squandered by (my ex-client) Boris Johnson, to say nothing of Liz Truss and her reckless gamble.

Does it matter that 20% of Tory funding last year came from one businessman, with unashamedly extreme views – much of whose wealth comes from government contracts? Err, yes!

To deal with the mess we need to update old solutions and embrace new ones, without seeing the world through rose-tinted glasses or equally distorting ‘metaverse’ headsets. It’s about working with the parties when they make sense.  

Above all the most important job for any MP (at least for those who don’t have a second job) is to help resolve constituents' problems and remove ridiculous obstacles. I'm chomping at the bit to get started.

Having previously stood for Parliament in 2005 as the Labour candidate in Cheltenham, I was elected the Member of Parliament for Islwyn in 2010.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, running as well as watching most sports.

My political journey traces its roots back to the heart of this region, where I began my career as a parliamentary researcher working alongside Highland and island MSPs. Having moved to Scotland from Brussels in my late teens, I immersed myself in the vibrant tapestry of Scottish life, pursuing my passion for public communication through degrees at QMU in Edinburgh and Stirling University. Armed with a strong foundation in critical thinking and problem-solving, I ventured into the corridors of power, working at both the European Parliament and Holyrood.



In 2016, personal circumstances led me to London, where I embarked on a new chapter in charity operations and finance, even retraining as an accountant. Guided by a commitment to social justice, I assumed leadership roles within the Violence against Women sector, advocating tirelessly for those in need. Today, as Head of Operations and Finance at the Political Studies Association, I continue to champion transparency, pragmatism, and community engagement.



Driven by a profound belief in the transformative power of politics, I am unwavering in my dedication to championing the voices of our communities. As we navigate the complexities of our time, I stand firm in my commitment to socialist principles, working tirelessly to build a future where every individual has the opportunity to thrive and prosper. Together, let us forge a path toward a more just and equitable society for all.

As a Risk Engineer, I assess organizations for insurance purposes and guide them towards the best solutions. My background includes insurance underwriting, health and safety, property construction, fire and security protection, and business continuity. In my role, I help both insurers and clients find the right balance between risk and reward. It's a fascinating job that allows me to work with a variety of public sector, housing, and large commercial organizations. What are your hobbies?

We have sheep, horses, and cats, so a good amount of my time is spent caring for them. I also enjoy playing five-a-side football and going to the gym. Occasionally, I go for a jog or hike across the moors. We love live music and you can often find me enjoying bands at the Polished Knob or Burnley Mechanics. Why are you running for election?

Why vote for the Liberal Democrats rather than Labour or Conservative?

I want to genuinely help and support people.  As a local person right in the heart of the community who is approachable, a good listener and empathetic I KNOW I can make a difference.

I'm a mum and have taught music in St Buryan, Mousehole, Newlyn, Trythall, Ludgvan Mounts Bay and other schools over the past decade. Currently I teach piano in Mounts Bay and Ludgvan Schools.  Before this I worked for a government initiative that worked with Schools in Penwith and on the Lizard and was about promoting creativity and skills for  21st Century teaching.  Crucially, this role was about 'change' and needed people to trust and work together.  I believe my work during this time would stand me in good stead in trying to resolve issues and matters that may straddle different sectors and cross many agendas.   

I think we are at a critical point politically at the moment with the Climate Emergency and Covid.  The only way now to make sure 'we're ok' is to make sure everyone is 'ok.'  We can no longer just avoid these things that we may not like but have to face up to the reality of them.  I have been motivated to stand as I feel it is so important that we don't go back to the same old 'normal' of before but we demand better from our elected representatives.   I'm not a fan of three word slogans and sound bites, a media intent on keeping itself in business by pitting parties or people against  one another, and politicians often more ego driven than 'people and principles' driven.  So I want to enter the fray as someone who IS motivated purely  by a desire to help people and make a difference and who has got values and principles.  I (and you) deserve people at the very least who are in it for the right reasons. It should not take a footballer and overwhelming public feeling for a government to realise it is doing the wrong thing.  Nor should it be difficult for a strong leader to 'cancel' Christmas when it was obvious that this was going to have horrendous implications.  This was the one time for me when I needed to trust in government and for me, it simply wasn't there.

But what I did see though was how at this moment people stepped up into that void. I watched first hand as communities and people came together. The positivity and support that came out of such an overwhelming situation was incredible and we HAVE to build from this. I believe in people and this is what has inspired me to do my bit. I believe that mostly we are tolerant, compassionate and kind but I also feel that in more recent times we have become a country divided; we seem unable to move forwards or upwards out of this and sometimes our worst sides are 'played to' by the media and politicians. I believe we must actively seek to find the things that connect us in order to grow a healthy, sustainable and secure future for all. I have never been one to give up on problems but try to find the commmonality and links between people to enable resolution and find a shared way ahead. I believe I would make a strong councillor, able to listen to and 'hear' your issues, fears and concerns.  It has been humbling walking around this division these past weeks and gaining a small insight into the issues that affect us. Some I was aware of and others have made me open my eyes.  All I know is that I am not one to shy away from difficult issues and like getting to the bottom of things.  I know most things are not black and white. I also am not one to give up! There is ALWAYS a solution if you have the will and the tenacity to keep at it!  I would stand up for everyone and ensure that ALL voices are heard. I would strive to help everyone feel proud of and that they are a real part of this community and locality. We deserve to feel confident in our future but must realise that we all have a part to play given the climate emergency and must take this on together. Thank you for reading.

My mum was an NHS nurse and my dad, Dr Charles Moon, was a GP in Camborne and Redruth for over 40 years.

Over the last year, I have listened to thousands of residents on doorsteps right across Camborne, Redruth & Hayle, and heard so many accounts of people struggling to make ends meet. Thirteen years of Conservative government failure have seen our public services cut to the bone, our economy collapse, a cost-of-living crisis with heating bills and food prices getting ever more expensive, and a meltdown in our NHS and social care system.

In my working life, I am a director of an electric vehicle charging point business that uses only sustainable energy. I liaise daily with local and national government to encourage them to roll our sustainable energy to reduce climate change.

Outside work, I am a keen environmentalist, a regular sea swimmer, a big Reds rugby fan, a youth coach and an amateur cricketer. I am passionate about ensuring that, once again, Camborne, Redruth & Hayle becomes a fantastic place to be raised, work, bring up a family and retire.

The Labour Party has a plan to restart our economy, create high skilled, sustainable jobs, build truly affordable housing, clean up our rivers and seas, deal with crime and anti-social behaviour and fix our NHS and social care services.

I spent my first year after graduating living on Canterbury Street, running my own small business as a special needs worker for young children. After working for long enough to afford to do a PGCE, I completed my secondary PGCE at Fitzwilliam College. Since then, I have been working as a teacher at a school in Suffolk, so I am well aware of the issues facing young people trying to commute in and out of the city, and making difficult decisions about whether they can afford to live and work in Cambridge.

I am now the Head of my department, and also co-ordinate the teacher training programmes across the school. These roles require me to organise myself and others meticulously, communicate clearly and passionately, and get people to do what I want them to do – all useful qualities for a City Councillor!

I am happy now to have been able to call Cambridge my home for 11 years, and I have just bought my first home locally so can safely say I am here to stay. I feel very privileged to have the opportunity to represent Castle ward on May 3rd, and hope you will offer me your support.

 

Why I am running in Castle Ward:

I find it frustrating and unfair that people living in a city with the wealth and talent of Cambridge still has to suffer from inequality and inadequate Council services. Levels of homelessness are rising, and there is increasing evidence that key workers such as nurses and teachers cannot afford to live in the City. The roads in Castle are grid-locked, and our pavements are riddled with potholes. I think a new voice is needed on the Council: a different and dynamic voice which has first-hand experience of struggles young people face trying to live and work in the area. I think it is time for a change for Castle ward.

Cambridge is a wonderful place to live, but I think we can do more to ensure that as the City grows, it does not suffocate under its own success. I know that residents in Castle suffer from the impact of this every day, with grid-locked roads, difficulty finding parking spaces near their homes and almost unusable public transport.

The Greater Cambridge partnership is making steps to try and improve this situation, but progress is frustratingly slow. I am running for the City Council because I believe that we can do more to ensure that decisions about the future of Cambridge infrastructure are made with the best interests of all residents in mind. Castle has a number of hard-working and dedicated residents’ associations who have done excellent work in the area and have pushed tirelessly for better decision making on key projects like Histon Road and Madingley Road. It is thanks to their work that some poor plans, including removing safe cycling and pedestrian routes on these roads have been prevented so far. I think it is scandalous that these residents associations have had to do so much to ensure that residents’ views are considered in the future plans for Cambridge, when this should be part of a process which goes without saying: a strong voice on the Council is needed to ensure that residents are supported, listened to, and their views acted upon.

What I will achieve if elected:

I have already been working hard with residents in the proposed new Benson North and Wilberforce parking zones to consult with them about the issues they face day in and day out with parking in their area, the results of which will feed into future decision making about the parking zones. If I am elected on May 3rd, I will be able to have even more of an impact on this decision making, and ensure that common sense and the experience of those living in an area are at the centre of all decision making.

I will push the Council to tackle difficult planning challenges head on, such as Histon Road and Madingley Road. I think we need a more “joined up” approach to decision making, considering the impact that changes to key infrastructure will have on the neighbouring areas and roads.

I think it is time the Council had a fresh, challenging voice, and with your support on May 3rd, I will provide this for you.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/35883/42dbf087-6be4-4beb-8181-228d3ea1adc1.png

As a life-long environmentalist Daniel is proud to be a shadow Environment Minister. It's a great job but what he really wants to be is the Environment Minister in Keir Starmer's next Labour Government with the power to make positive changes to tackle the climate emergency.

Daniel is a member of Greenpeace and has brought leaders on divestment to speak in Cambridge. He is also a bee fan -- he is a passionate Species Champion for the Ruderal Bumblebee and he campaigns to stop bee-killing pesticides.

After a decade of Tory rule, Cambridge people are suffering. There is a cost-of-living crisis and our public services have been cut to the bone. Daniel cares about social justice and he is a recognised Living Wage Foundation Parliamentary Champion. He has worked closely with students on the Cambridge University Living Wage campaign and with councillors to make Cambridge a proud Living Wage City.

As your MP, Daniel has been a leading voice for more funding for the police, against privatisation of local health services and for more cash for Cambridgeshire's NHS, including for better provision for mental health. He has led the campaign for fairer funding for Cambridge's schools and against cuts to nursery schools. He has been instrumental in securing laws to take back control of our local bus services.

As a constitutional reformer, Daniel backs an elected second chamber as well as votes at 16. Daniel is a patron of the Westminster Higher Education Forum, which aims to raise the quality of debate on public policy.

Daniel is Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Data Analytics and he is a recognised Champion for the Internet Watch Foundation. He is also a national Champion for Cancer Research UK.

Daniel lives on Victoria Road in Cambridge with his partner Barbara, known as 'Budge', very close to where they lived when they met as students at King's College.

Before he became MP for Cambridge, Daniel had a variety of jobs in the public and private sectors, including working as a national officer for UNISON for 12 years to tackle women's low pay and racism. He also ran his own business.

Outside politics, Daniel enjoys football, live music and walking. He was, in his youth, a promising middle-distance runner. He is a Cambridge United season-ticket holder and he can often be found enjoying chamber concerts at Kettle's Yard.

Henry lives with his wife, Sarah, and three young children in a small village near Canterbury where he has lived since he was six years old.  His children attend the same village primary school that he attended.

A former pupil of the Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys in Canterbury, Henry went on to train as a teacher at Canterbury Christ Church University and later studied Computer Science at the University of Kent. He has been a member of the Green Party since 2014 and this will be his second general election standing as the Green candidate.

“I have always wanted to work in ways that will help people—that is why I was a teacher for 16 years—being their MP would give me the opportunity to really help local people,” says Henry, who is actively involved in his local community.

“The Green Party is the only party that offers a complete and credible vision of a fairer and greener country.

“Most people I talk to tell me they just want the Canterbury area to be a pleasant place to live and work in—with good housing, good quality transport, green spaces, decent healthcare and good schools.”

Living within a tight-knit community in the countryside, Henry is passionate about the natural environment and supporting rural communities.

He commented: “People in our rural districts are just not served by the local Council, nor our current government. We have lost our mobile libraries, local post offices and pubs. Our schools and GP surgeries are oversubscribed and the bus network is being cut back.”

“I have lived in the same Kent village, just a few kilometres outside Canterbury city centre, almost all my life and I get frustrated when I see this silent minority being let down year after year.”

Henry helped local Green Party activists fight back against the unacceptable levels of sewage pollution in the area. Local Greens raised their own funding and carried out a citizen-science water-quality testing programme, to prove the scale of the pollution from Southern Water.

“We need to grab the bull by the horns and have a massive overhaul of how we manage sewage and wastewater treatment in the District and across the UK,” he says.

“We can’t keep building more and more luxury housing estates on green fields and not invest in infrastructure—it’s not sensible and it’s not sustainable.”",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/27288.png

Local people are fed up with governments and a council which takes them for granted. As a councillor in the area for many years, I have fought hard for many improvements to ensure the area is well served – from new crossings and other road safety schemes to make our streets safer, to a new library and new Welsh medium schools.

All too often I have seen local Labour representatives who have failed to listen and act on concerns from the community. Far too many people tell me they don’t think Labour is really listening to them on issues like tackling the increasing congestion we’re seeing on Cardiff’s roads, addressing cuts to local bus services or fighting to secure the re-opening of Pentwyn Leisure Centre. They despair at the quality of some of our local services like waste collections and the threat to reduce the frequency of black bin collections, while repeatedly being asked to pay more and more in council tax.

All too often I note that our current Labour MP and MS are silent on such concerns, so we really do need a local champion who will be more vocal and who will put this area first.

There is no other place in the world like it. Yet, outside the centre, there are too few green spaces and those that do exist are under threat from sprawling development. Streets and underpasses regularly flood with surface water and the Taff is treated as a sewer by water companies who build their pumping stations in parks.

People in Cardiff North are not being listened to.

My background is in Community, Education and Sport. A qualified teacher and award-winning coach and business owner, I’ve spent my whole life helping others and lifting their voices up to be heard. From leading teams to national titles to setting up four community clubs in South Wales, I know how to work with people to get things done. In the last year alone, I’ve successfully campaigned to restore bus routes; helped to run events for disabled athletes; and been part of a team fundraising for Women’s Charities. Much of my work has also involved working with Refugees, teaching English to Afghan women and witnessing first hand the heartache of being separated from family by borders and bureaucracy.

I’m so proud of the people of Wales. That we have the heart, empathy and vision to welcome those fleeing war and persecution - and I’m proud too that the Green Party has been one of the most determined voices calling for an immediate Ceasefire and release of all hostages in Gaza.

At the end of it all, I’m an accidental politician. Here because of the hope and trust I see in my children’s eyes each morning rather than because of any grand ambition. We cannot let greed, inequality and selfish short termism be our legacy. Austerity has failed. The pursuit of endless wealth on a finite planet has failed. The answers – and a bright, brilliant future - are out there. Only waiting for a party with the political will to enact them.

Your vote is special. It matters. Please lend it to me so that we can work together to build something better for the generations to come.

My family have lived in Carlisle for generations. Walk across Eden, Harraby or St Nicholas bridges and you'll find my Great Grandfather's name on the plaque commemorating their opening. My mam was a Carr's cracker packer and later a homehelp. After serving in the second world war, dad worked as a painter and decorator at Norweb.

I grew up in a small terraced house in Denton Holme, went to Robert Ferguson and Trinity schools and my first fulltime job was at 14MU. Like other working class families, mine believed in working hard to give your children a better future. I was the first person in my family to go to university. After graduating, I - like many of our young people - moved away from Carlisle for work. I managed an MP's office, responding to hundreds of constituent enquiries. That's why I know that being an MP isn't a part-time job. It's the job. And it's time Carlisle had a fulltime MP.

I worked in the voluntary sector, campaigning for disabled people and for laws to safeguard children. As a senior manager in industry I shaped policies and regulation to protect millions of consumers.

I'm the mother of a student nurse so I don't need to watch the news to know that the Tories have pushed our doctors, nurses, paramedics, health assistants and care staff to breaking point. After 14 years of Conservative failure waiting lists are never ending, seeing a GP is increasingly difficult and local people have more chance of winning the lottery than they have of registering with an NHS dentist. Yet again the Conservatives have proved that our health service is not safe in their hands.

In 2021 I founded a charity to save Carlisle's Victorian Baths because I have confidence in our city. I have confidence that a Labour Government will unleash the potential of our city. And I am confident that I have the experience to be a strong voice for our city in Parliament.

Get in touch and let's realise Carlisle's potential together.

Political interests started with Greenpeace aged 16. For 20y I have developed environmental exoertise in the energy & buildings sector, delivering governmental projects across Sutton, South West London & further afield.

An advocate for empowerment, I sat on Croydon’s Scrutiny Sub-committee, so I know how councils & agencies work and have a track record of raising issues & representing people. My professionalism earns wide respect. I stand up for what I believe in and thus have stood in elections at all levels over the past 9y. We need to change how we do things - in society, industry, and government - but have precious little time to avert climate catastrophe. I've promoted environmental issues on all media & on street corners. The Green Party has the solutions, knowledge & the will to enact the changes needed.

Solving problems is my forte - troubleshooting - from events to presentations, for young & old. I've been brave enough to try new ideas but equally pulled together others who have expertise to create a great team and get things done (voluntary/third sector, schools, NGOs, lobbying groups, policing & anti-social behaviour, community groups).

I was born and brought up in the constituency and live here too. I did my public service overseas as British Trade Commissioner for South Asia securing billions of pounds of investment that created thousands of jobs in Scotland and the UK. With the Scottish Whisky Association for example, I secured a major reduction in whisky tarrifs in India - resulting in many more bottles sold and safeguarding jobs here in Scotland. Now I'd like to use my experience to represent the community where I grew up in Parliament.



Having spoken to thousands of voters across Central Ayrshire since I was selected, it's clear are people are fed up with the SNP and the Tories. Only Scottish Labour can beat the SNP here and only a Labour Government can deliver for the people of Central Ayrshire. If elected, I will:



Tackle the cost of living crisis, cut household bills and put money back in your pocket;



Fight for better local services suffering eye-watering cuts from SNP- and Tory-led councils ;



Stand up for our local health services and support Labour's plans for an NHS fit for the future;



Work to create new high-quality jobs, a genuine living wage and opportunities for people here; and



Promote our high streets and local businesses and bring pride back to our town centres.

We had very little money and at times it was very tough. I consider myself very lucky to be the first in my family to go to University and I will never forget that my success owes a lot to the sacrifices of others.



I served 17 years as a Labour Councillor in London and I first stood for Parliament in South Suffolk back in 2005 when I campaigned to protect the NHS, taking local voices all the way to Downing Street. I have been supporting charities in Suffolk for many years including fundraising for East Anglia Children's Hospices and recently helping to protect the life-saving work of Felixstowe Coastal Patrol. My work as a Councillor included saving millions of pounds of taxpayers money (winning national awards) and helping thousands of people over 17 years of service.



During the Covid-19 Pandemic I wanted to do my bit and was proud to train as a Vaccinator with St Johns's Ambulance including working with NHS staff out of Gainsborough Sports Centre in Ipswich to help get our country back on its feet. The way that the Conservative Party and Boris Johnson behaved during the Covid-19 Pandemic, the way they partied in Downing Street while the country locked down, and the manner in which millions and millions of pounds of our money was lost to waste and corruption is a scandal. If Labour is given the honour to serve in Government we have pledged to get back the public money stolen and wasted.



I have spent years building up a successful career in business whilst also serving as a School Governor. I founded a company in 2006 and we now are over a hundred people working across the UK including being the largest communications agency in the East of England with its Head Office in Ipswich. I currently split my time between Suffolk and London and I also sit on the Advisory Board of the Eastern Powerhouse which exists to create jobs and support the economy in the East of England. Successful businesses, a strong economy, fiscal stability are the foundation stones on which a Labour Government, if given the honour to serve, will use to make our country better. I am passionate about the role of business to create jobs, change lives and give people the chance to fulfil their potential. The company I founded has given 5% of profits since day one and I am very proud of and grateful for that.



My mum worked as a NHS nurse and as a dinner lady. My dad worked on building sites and then as a security guard. My father in law served in the Marines and the Police. Public service and commitment to our country runs deep through my family. Some of the highlights of my working life include helping raise millions of pounds for Combat Stress, the charity supporting the mental health of our Military Veterans, and supporting the work of footballer Marcus Rashford to give children free school meals. My two daughters and being a father have brought me the most happiness in my life and I am deeply committed to giving every child in our country the chance to fulfil their potential. I have served for over a decade as a School Governor in Primary and Secondary State schools.



The General Election of 2024 gives us a huge opportunity both in Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, and across the whole of the UK. I know that Keir Starmer, if given the chance to serve, will be the Prime Minister our country needs to make our country great again.

I grew up in Suffolk and have lived in Ipswich since 2021. I am pleased to be serving my community as a Mid Suffolk district councillor for a second term after the Green Party won by a landslide at the recent local elections.  

My upbringing in the Suffolk countryside made me in awe of the natural world; hedgehogs, ponds alive with tadpoles and toads, and swarms of insects. In my twenties I lived in New Zealand for six years where I studied for my PhD in coastal ecology then worked as a researcher. Some of my colleagues spent their summer months in Antarctica, and their accounts of declining sea ice and impacted marine wildlife were eye opening. At home, we have all noticed striking changes in our seasons, extreme weather, water pollution and a decline in the abundance of local wildlife. The Green Party’s vision of a fair and sustainable economic system, where people can live comfortably within a thriving natural environment encouraged me into politics.

Unprecedented levels of heavy rain and saturated soils caused rainwater to flood homes and businesses across Suffolk. Framingham saw some of the worst impacts with water levels breaching the mere flooding over 70 homes. Debenham was also severely impacted with 50 homes internally flooded. 

Whilst storm events are inevitable, the vulnerability of households to flooding is not. Severe spending cuts to the agencies and councils that maintain drains and ditches means this work has been scaled back. Not only must we ensure that water can move away from areas at risk; we must retain and slow the flow of water upstream using Natural Flood Management measures and identifying opportunities for new flood defences. 

The recent release of beavers locally are a welcome contribution to both flood alleviation and environmental gain. Beavers are ecosystem engineers, creating wetlands that are valuable habitat for a range of species but also hold water and slow the flow. 

The other issue concerning water is water quality. Shareholder owned water companies continue to discharge sewage into our rivers with near impunity. Last year Anglian water were fined £2.65 million for illegal sewage overflow, but paid £4.5 billion to shareholders and servicing debts instead of upgrading sewage treatment systems.  At the same time, the government recently missed an opportunity mirror European legislation to help protect rivers from microplastic pollution.

Whilst water legislation needs to be strengthened, bringing our water companies back into public ownership is the only way to ensure they are truly accountable and that infrastructure investment is at the level needed. These improvements could be financed through a revived, publicly owned Green Investment Bank. We could also consider a staged approach, by purchasing some shares now then more later, that would return these companies to public ownership and reduce the immediate burden of cost. Only through government investment can we ensure services work for the common good and secure a healthy environment for future generations.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/58399.png

Our country is crying out for change. But as every day passes, this chaotic, damaging Conservative government stumbles from one self-inflicted crisis to the next.



Together we can fix the NHS, tackle the cost-of-living crisis and build good homes people can afford to live in. We can repair our damaged economy and restore our relationship with Europe.



I believe people working together can make things better, fairer and kinder -- and I'll be an MP firmly on your side.



Please don't just hope for better, vote for it.

I attended St Martin’s School of Art where I completed a BA in Fine Art in 1990, and then went on to do a Masters in Fine Art at Chelsea School of Art.  Over the subsequent 15 years, my artistic practice took me on a global journey, exhibiting in venues across London, New York, Italy, and China. This immersive experience in the arts instilled in me a deep-seated curiosity about the human psyche and our interaction with the world around us.  In 2000, wanting to explore beyond my internal dialogue and the confines of my studio, I started a business in Architectural Design and development with my husband.  In 2004 we moved to the south of France where we lived for 17 years, and where our son was born.  Living abroad afforded me invaluable insights into the challenges of integration and the universal quest for connection across linguistic and cultural divides. Witnessing firsthand the nuances of a different political system, I developed an  understanding of governance and the potential for cross-cultural exchange. My time in France cultivated a keen awareness of the complexities inherent in societal structures and a commitment to harnessing the best practices from diverse cultures to enrich our own. As a parliamentary candidate, I bring a unique perspective shaped by my multifaceted and multi-cultural experiences with a dedication to fostering inclusive policies that honour our shared humanity and collective progress.

I believe our nation is in crisis, threatening our core values of good governance, social welfare, and tolerance. I'm driven by a duty to uphold fairness and balance between collective and individual needs. The Green Party's manifesto offers solutions to societal inequalities, and I'm dedicated to leading the charge for policy reform. It's evident that current governance is failing, and we need a new direction. The climate crisis provides an opportunity for change towards economic sustainability, social justice, and environmental stewardship. As a parliamentary candidate, I'm committed to championing this vision for a better future.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/115992/b285e30d-077c-469b-9887-03a87c13687c.png

I have been a Labour member all of my adult life when I can afford it and an activist when I cannot. I feel that the values that the Labour Party hold match my own. I come from a traditional working-class family, and as such have seen the benefits that a Labour government can bring to those who need a bit of a helping hand.

I am proud to have represented Tewkesbury as prospective Parliamentary candidate in the 2019 General Election.

Raised on the West Marsh in Grimsby, with the poorest, the best and brightest of people, I wasn’t told by teachers that I couldn’t achieve, achievement wasn’t considered for a child like me. Thatcher at the helm, a time of desperation, of a decimated dock and fishing industry, of no hope, of watching my dad cry because the Tories took his dockers job. My sister, who is incredibly bright, should have gone to Oxbridge, denied though as she was a poor kid, and a university education simply wasn’t considered for people like us. I was homeless at 16, pregnant with my daughter at 18, despite this, I managed to achieve a great career and financial stability. Both my background and career give me a wealth of understanding about the barriers of lifting others out of poverty or improving business. I achieved despite a broken system; created by a Tory government, with help from my union, the local Labour Party, and an excellent Labour government. My background gives me resilience, drive, determination, and an understanding of social mobility.

I am union to the core. My dedication to the principles of solidarity, fairness, and justice runs deep in my veins. As a representative of the University and College Union (UCU), I am privileged to advocate for the rights and well-being of educators and academic staff as a workplace rep. I am also a member of Unite the Union.

My political interests are:

* The rural community has been forgotten and taken for granted by the Tories. As a member of NFU I am fully aware of the issues that places that surround Cheltenham are impacted by rural crime, fly tipping and expensive housing that the local community cannot afford.

* Higher education, often neglected in parliamentary discourse, really needs a friend in parliament. A university education provided by a great Labour government and their Widening Participation scheme allowed be to escape poverty. Higher Education is a right and not a privilege and can help provide our doctors and nurses, teachers, dentists etc that our country is so desperately needed.

* The Tories voting for sewage to be pumped into our rivers and seas is a stark reminder of the Tories' disregard for the environment and public health and to the beauty of our area.

I now live in Easebourne village with my wife and two children. I’m happiest when I am outdoors, walking, running or Mountain Biking on the South Downs.

I have always been fascinated by politics and I studied Politics at University. The climate crisis, and the realisation that the mainstream parties would never take meaningful action, spurred me to get actively involved in Green politics.

I am a committed campaigner with experience of four local elections. I’ve twice stood as a candidate and have a proven track record of winning votes in traditional Tory heartlands:   In 2020 I was a County Council candidate. I finished second to the Conservative candidate with 550 votes, more than Lib Dem and Labour combined and 20% of votes cast. This was with no literature or posters. Just me with a green rosette knocking on doors for 2 hours a night.   This year I was elected as a District Councillor in the Chichester South Ward with 950 votes   As a District Councillor I am on the Environment Panel. I was inspired by Carla Denyer’s action on Bristol Council to declare a Climate Emergency. My first action as a Councillor was to propose that the Environment panel should write to our MPs in support of Caroline Lucas’ Climate and Ecology Bill. I worked to persuade members from all parties and the motion was unanimously passed.

My day job is delivering large-scale rooftop solar projects for manufacturing businesses, so I speak confidently about climate change, energy policy and how the Green Industrial Revolution can work in practice.   It is vitally important to run a robust and energetic General Election campaign: We need to show the people of Chichester that the only party who will take meaningful action on Climate Change is the Green Party. I will fight for Green solutions like Carbon Tax, Universal Basic Income and Home Insulation.

I’ve shown my commitment to campaigning for The Green Party and the skills I have demonstrated whilst campaigning and in my role as a Councillor are transferable to the role of a Green MP.  I will always be campaigning, persuading and influencing for a fairer, greener country.

My degree in Politics and career in renewable energy mean I can confidently speak about green issues, but my real point of difference is my proven ability to get people to turn out and vote for me. With your support I have a real chance of getting us over the line.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/73930-62097e94-aa73-47ad-ad4c-77a1724e99ed.png

Mark is standing for the constituency of Chipping Barnet as he believes a change is desperately needed after years of chaos under the Conservatives. He believes in the Lib Dem vision of a fair deal for all. He also understands the issues around living in an outer London borough. 

Mark is a Councillor and Media Executive who lives in London, with his wife, a Tutor, and  former Maths Teacher. 

He is a passionate believer in local communities working together for the common good. He was honoured to be re-elected to serve his community after running a successful campaign with the local party in a special election in 2022.  He believes in housing with good planning and good access to doctors, dentists, and good schooling. He is proud to be part of an administration in Kingston that is building the largest number of new council houses for over 40 years. He serves on the committee that is overseeing  the renewal of the Cambridge Road Housing Estate in Kingston, which includes over 800 much needed affordable and council homes. He also served on the Corporate and Resources Committee which oversees the budgeting for the council,the pension panel, and the Children and Adult Social Care and Education Committee.  Within his own ward he has overseen a significant expansion of EV charging, improvements in local parks, and the local train station, and the building of a new Junior School.      

He is a seasoned campaigner having won his own seat twice. He is well known to local residents, and this has come about by being an active member of his local community, regular canvassing, and intelligent use of social media to get across local news. 

He has had a near 30 year career in Advertising in major media companies. More recently a technology start-up, and so understands the importance of small business to growing our economy.      He has 3 grown up children, and a new grandchild in 2023.

We have loved exploring our new community and getting to know everything there is to offer here.



I see daily how overstretched our NHS is though, how hard it is to get a dentist appointment and the stress of finding appropriate housing. I see the consequence of less police on crime in our communities and making people feel less safe in their high streets. I feel the impact of the cost of living crisis on the everyday decisions we make, and the extreme pressure our schools are under from chronic underfunding. I worry that the sewage being pumped into our rivers and seas is causing irreversible damage for future generations.



My parents; a GP and a nurse, instilled in me the importance of public service. This has shaped my career decision as a lawyer to specialise in public law and professional discipline. I hear constantly on the doorstep how disillusioned people are with politicians and that they cannot be trusted. I am passionate about upholding the rule of law and professional standards - honesty and integrity are fundamental to me. It is time for change, not only so that we can build back our communities which are suffering after many years of harmful decisions by Conservative governments, but so we can once again have confidence and trust in those who are elected to represent us.



As we prepare for the General Election, I am working hard in Christchurch and with our neighbouring constituencies to share Labour's message so that together we can bring Labour MP's to Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole to work to ensure all of our communities fulfil their potential.

I believe I am well positioned to represent the area and its residents in line with our Green values and fantastic policy programme.

'As London Assembly candidate for West Central London, I have campaigned across our boroughs.  I have also worked with elected officials and candidates, including Zack Polanski and Zoe Garbett, to welcome West Central’s very first councillor over from Labour.

'My main priorities for the constituency are homelessness, housing, food recycling, and air quality.  Homelessness is a tragedy that is also a political choice.  Successive governments from establishment parties have made it clear that this tragedy is not a top priority for them.  The Finnish capital city Helsinki shows that a series of relatively simple decisions can essentially end homelessness if the political will is there.  Housing is a big issue too, with not enough social housing and not nearly enough intermediate housing.  It is unacceptable that intermediate housing – listed on the london.gov.uk website as ‘one of the main forms of affordable homes built in London’ – should be so lacking in the constituency in which the government sits.'",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/109011/8fcf02f3-c3d6-4a04-ab82-d7d66b07cdbe.png

Hello, I’m Jonathan Elmer.  I’m a County Councillor representing Brandon on Durham County Council.   I’m also the National Green Party spokesperson for Nature.  I’ve spent my career working as a teacher, countryside / parks team leader and later as a consultant ecologist.  Throughout my career I’ve worked to rebuild the broken relationship between people and the nature on our planet without which we couldn’t exist.

As the first Green County Councillor I have a Countywide remit and have persuaded the Council to declare an Ecological Emergency and commit to actions that restore our collapsing local ecosystems.  I’ve also been pushing the Council to improve our broken public transport system, tackle local air pollution, and conserve the built heritage of our beautiful City.  As a member of the planning committee I’ve played a leading roll in standing up against the conversion of family homes to HMOs, and always fight for better transport connectivity, reduced impact to wildlife and access to local green spaces.

If elected I would champion the needs of our City in Westminster.  My top priorities would be:

implementation of a clean air zone; resisting development that impacts on the heritage of our City; challenging the unsustainable expansion of Durham University; halting the conversion of family homes to HMOs making our roads safer and more accessible for pedestrians and cyclists Please vote for me.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/22817-fc77ab04-2391-4f5f-a8ce-f3e738c6b4cd.png

That’s because, having been born, raised, educated, worked, and served as a local councillor in County Durham, I have learnt how to get things done.

Working with Robert Potts, the Durham Police & Crime Commissioner Candidate, I'm campaigning to stop the closure of our local police stations and custody suites. We need to serve the communities of County Durham by improving police response times, and the best way to do that is to base police officers locally.

As a former Business Development Director for a County Durham based company, I know the struggles our small and medium enterprises face on a daily basis. In 2021, I launched my own business, which could not compete the challenges presented during the COVID-19 pandemic. I want to work with our local business owners to secure their futures by working on long term strategies to support sustainable economic growth and job creation in our community.

In 2021, I made it my mission to improve Whitworth Park Academy in Spennymoor from Inadequate to Good. Working with the school's leadership team and academy trust, we delivered the improvements and secured a Good rating within just two years. I have already started meeting with schools in Willington, New Brancepeth and across the constituency, with the aim of supporting our teachers to make the improvements needed to give our kids the best start in life.

We need to bring power closer to people. That means more local responses from councils and respecting and strengthening our Senedd, holding it to account on health, education agriculture and transport. Westminster politicians have no place interfering in that.

The UK government needs to get to grips with economic fairness and a greener, more innovative economy.

Well-being and security mean we should work together much more closely to rebuild our relations with our European Union allies and neighbours in an increasingly uncertain world. We need to get on with clear steps towards eventually rejoining the European Union.

A local teacher for many years, my route into politics came straight from my classroom. I saw life getting more and more difficult for the families of the children coming through my door under this Tory government and felt driven to tackle the inequalities that create barriers to opportunities for so many.

That drive led me to become a Labour councillor. As Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Education, Children and Families in Denbighshire, I am proud to be working in partnership with our Welsh Labour government to put Labour values into action.

I can see first-hand though just how much needs to change and how much more could be achieved with a UK Labour government, working hand in hand with our Welsh Labour government, to make life better for us all.

I will be Clwyd North's voice around the decision-making tables and in Parliament to bring investment to our towns and villages, create a skilled, local workforce, unlock our huge green energy potential, break down barriers to opportunity for our children and young people and so much more.

From Rhyl to Colwyn Bay, from Rhuddlan to Denbigh -- I will speak up and stand up to create the better future we deserve.

The family is a source of joy that underpins society and the state should not take the place of the family but provide support to enable the family to raise children according to their beliefs and values. Strong families and parenthood should be honoured as a high calling through which many of the seemingly intractable problems in society could be better addressed. Society needs a healthy democratic enviornement with openness and improved accountability especially at a local level. Public debate and information should not be dominated by central Government funded agencies or charities who simply promote the ruling parties agenda. Introducing referenda  when the government is ignoring the will of a majority would enhance the participation of people in political decision making. The Scottish Family Party does not support Hate Crime legislation and believes that men and women naturally have different interests and priorities. We wish to see society unified rather than divided by identity based politics that divides people into oppressors and oppressed causing people to feel afraid to express their beliefs even in their own home. We support freedom of religion and freedom of speech.  In schools policies such as the 'named person approach' treat parents as secondary to professionals or experts and the focus should move instead to educational rigour rather than the subjective approach of the curriculumn for excellence. The taxation system should make allowances transferrable so that insread of taxing individuals separetly the family is taxed as a whole with allowances for dependent children so that one parent can remain at home to dedicate his or her time to home life. Council Tax should be discounted when the family has children.  The law should reflect the fact that life begins at conception with protection for the child in the womb and the Scottish Family Party wishes to see better support with independent counselling and the involvement of fathers in decision-making. The denial of prolife coinselling to women and exploration of adoption for the child is very damaging to women and the voice of prolife politicians need to be heard in Holyrood.

Recognizing the pressing issues of violent crime, including knife crime and violence against women, Paul vows to prioritize these critical areas, ensuring that our streets are safe for all residents. Drawing on years of experience and a deep understanding of local dynamics, Paul will work tirelessly to implement targeted strategies to address these specific challenges head-on.

But the Liberal Democrats knows that true progress requires more than just reactive measures. With a focus on prevention, Paul aims to reduce crime at its roots, investing in community initiatives, youth programs, and early intervention strategies. By addressing the underlying factors that contribute to criminal behavior, Paul is committed to creating lasting change and building a safer, more prosperous future for Cheshire.

Central to Paul's platform is the implementation of restorative justice practices, offering a compassionate and effective alternative to traditional punitive measures. By fostering accountability, healing, and reconciliation, restorative justice not only reduces reoffending but also strengthens community bonds, promoting a sense of trust and cooperation between law enforcement and the public.

With deep roots in the community, Paul brings a wealth of experience to the table. Married and parent of two, Paul understands the importance of building a secure environment for families to thrive. Moreover, Paul's tenure as a town councillor reflects a proven dedication to public service and a keen understanding of local governance.

I went to University in Aberystwyth and then Glasgow, studying Maths, Energy and the Environment. Afterwards, I worked as an environmental volunteer, and then for five years with a charity, training people to carry out home energy audits and promoting energy efficiency for affordable warmth. After that, I met my wife, became a teacher, moved to Dumbarton, got married, became a father, moved again to follow my wife’s career to Alsager, with a four-year spell in Congleton. Now, having left teaching, and having experienced a period of foster caring, I am in the enviable position of being a house-husband.

Our society is not fair. In the last ten years, the government has removed vast swathes of our social estate; the backbone of life in Britain which is there to support us all - rich or poor - in small or large amounts, depending on our need and at different stages in our lives. We must replace that with a proper end to austerity – not just for an election year. We need more resources for education; for mental health; for an NHS with fewer pills and quick fixes, and more physiotherapists and osteopaths; for a law system which can properly represent those of us without a six-figure bank balance; for libraries and public spaces; for the police; and for services for the elderly that allow them to continue to live in their own home, a protected home, or in a home specifically tailored toward their needs.

We also need to stop the constant privatisation of our country. This privatisation has “given us” much lower levels of effective service, made us poorer, and unsure about our jobs and our lives, prevented us from knowing who we need to contact about fixing or improving things, and has made huge profits for a very few.

Britain is hugely responsible for climate change. Historically, we have emitted more CO2 per person over the last 200 years than any other nation in the world. Most of that carbon is still there, creating havoc with the world’s climate. So now we should lead the way in demonstrating that we can live in a carbon-free society where we derive all our energy from renewable sources. This will require us to change our habits as well as prioritise the use of our limited resources – like steel, concrete, and rare earth metals which will needed to build renewable energy systems.

The Green Party way is fairer and more democratic – to encourage us all to take part by having a more representative voting system, with more decisions taken locally and fewer decisions overridden by government ministers. It is to encourage people to make the right decisions through sensible and realistic uses of taxation. It is to make us a society with the time and the resources to care about our neighbours and communities rather than only being able to focus on family and friends.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/71381.png

Real positive and lasting change will not be achieved by Parties who keep doing the same thing endlessly to appease the interests of those who currently benefit most from the inaction we see on the climate catastrophe and rising inequality.

 

Only the Green Party are actively campaigning for policies that will address the root causes of the ills that currently sweep our nation and stand up for those who most need an active voice working for their interests, and not those of the major polluters or media moguls who sow discord amongst society to further their own financial interests – who are currently very well represented in Westminster.

 

I shall be an active voice campaigning for changes to the voting system to ensure people’s votes truly count; for policies that protect our environment to allow us to live healthier lives and to secure the future for those who shall inherit our world after we have had our time as custodians; to work to reduce inequality and to ensure those with the broadest shoulders bear more of the weight for the changes we and our planet need.

 

I have worked as a Social Worker for over a decade and previously volunteered with a number of charities, as well as working as a delivery driver, Door Supervisor and postman. I am proud  of my working class background, as well as being the first person in my family to attend University and enter a professional role. In my professional life I have supported a vast number of people with a considerable range of challenges, from homelessness to addiction to accessing services that had previously excluded them. I have a lived experience of working endless hours for little reward and the challenges this can bring.

For 14 years, I have served Crawley as a borough councillor. During my eight years as council leader, I delivered balanced budgets without making front line cuts, oversaw Crawley’s return to council house building on a scale not seen for decades, and helped to secure hundreds of millions of pounds of investment in the town which saw Crawley become the densest centre of employment in the country outside of London.

I am running in this election because, after years of struggle on the ground, I know that the challenges facing Crawley on the ground cannot be resolved at the local level any longer, they need a change in Government. We urgently need a solution to our cost of living crisis, to Crawley’s housing emergency, and the underinvestment in our public sector which has left every service from the NHS to policing on the brink of collapse.

If elected, I will spend the next five years of the next Parliament working to secure:

1) A thriving local economy and support for the town centre 2) Housing which delivers for local people 3) A better future for Crawley’s children 4) Real action on crime and antisocial behaviour 5) A better-resourced NHS that’s there when you need it

Over recent years we’ve seen our country run into the ground - bills rising, businesses failing, and underfunded public services falling apart when we need them most.

As the COVID enquiry progresses we can see how the Conservative Government failed us when we needed them to be dealing with the pandemic. Sadly they are also completely failing us as we face the climate and ecological emergency that threatens the future of humanity.

But just getting the Conservatives out isn’t enough. The other parties are only offering tinkering around the edges, not real solutions to the problems we face.

That’s why I’m so proud of our Green New Deal policies. We are putting forward plans that not only tackle the climate emergency, they support small businesses, bring public services back into public hands, put money back into the local economy and back into people’s pockets. Our Green New Deal would make us a world leader in delivering a sustainable economy, an example to others and a country to be proud of.

We deserve better than the Government we have had, and we deserve better than the no-change options offered by the other opposition parties. If you want better, it’s time to vote for it. This time, vote Green.”

That's why I'm delighted to be standing to be Dartford's next MP

Dartford has been badly let down by the Tories and the town urgently needs a Labour government and local MP who will stand up on behalf of local people and fight to save our NHS, for safer streets, an end to the cost of living crisis and for genuinely affordable new homes for local people.

I have a track record in South East London in my role as councillor and campaigner for local communities including delivering big pay increases for low paid care workers and helping transform mental health services. I will bring the same commitment to social justice for local people after 14 wasted years under the Tories.

My partner Nicola is a secondary school teacher in a large local comprehensive school and our children who both went to south east London state schools and are now studying at university. I come from an armed services family and believe the UK needs strong defence and robust borders.



Priorities for change

My five priorities for change are those that Dartford residents have been telling party campaigners about on the doorsteps:

* Undoing the Tory damage to our NHS and care services, with rapid high-quality treatment for residents and an end to the current record long waits

* Housing for all with new build homes provided at genuinely affordable and social rents, help for people of all ages onto the housing ladder and an end to homelessness

* Fighting crime with more local police and with Dartford residents made safer from anti-social behaviour and violence against women and girls

Born and brought up in Dartford, Laura attended a local comprehensive, studied early years in further education and now works in a special educational needs (SEND) setting. 

Laura first became involved in politics through community projects, and continues to be active in organising these. Through this, she noticed that the lack of equality and unequal distribution of wealth that she was seeing were linked to political choices. This has been a driving force for her. 

Laura joined the Green Party in 2021, leaving the Labour Party as she felt that they were not offering strong enough policies on environmental and social issues. 

Since then, Laura has worked hard for Dartford borough, including proposals for reduction of glyphosate chemicals used for weed management, supporting local housing needs, and fighting for the protection of green spaces including Swanscombe Peninsula; she was instrumental in setting up the successful grassroots campaign Save Swanscombe Peninsula. She recently founded the Dartford Care Backpacks initiative which collects donated essentials items to give out to homeless individuals in need. 

Laura has also run a community safety group for several years, and is a strong voice for justice and peace. She has a Jewish heritage, and has been deeply troubled by the conflict, and the loss of Palestinian lives in Gaza, working with others to hold a vigil to bringing together people from all communities to reject hate, promote peace, and call for an immediate and lasting ceasefire. 

Laura sees standing for the Green Party as the only way to create a fairer, greener, and more socially just society. 

Laura is the Green Party’s candidate for Dartford at the next General Election.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/67341-70700c6b-a587-40a7-bdca-869ff73a4c5c.png

I am a family lawyer and mother of 4 grown-up sons. I have been a lifelong Conservative who benefitted greatly from Conservative policies which socially and economically enfranchised millions of people within the United Kingdom. I was born in Billericay and raised in Basildon, Essex. My grandparents on both sides were farmers and small holders. My parents were tenant farmers until their farm was taken from them to form part of what then became Basildon new town – something which left me with a life-long interest in the rights of the individual versus the state.

I grew up in a council house and went to a comprehensive school and then on to Brunel University and the Inns of Court School of Law. A member of Lincoln’s Inn, I was called to the bar in 1988 and established myself as a family law practitioner, dealing with divorce, care, adoption, child abduction and related issues. I have had local government experience, having served as a Basildon District Councillor, and contested the parliamentary seat of East Belfast in the 1997 Election. I am passionately committed to the countryside and the environment and am part of the “Vote Blue, Go Green” movement within the Conservative Party. I also think it is important to support all sections of the rural community.

As someone who has benefitted from the National Health Service, I am absolutely committed to increases in its funding to meet the growing demands of an ageing population that is also living longer, with multiple health needs. I voted Leave in the 2016 Referendum and strongly believe that trust in Parliament and politicians will not be restored until the result of that Referendum is delivered by the United Kingdom leaving the European Union. I have been living and campaigning in the Derbyshire Dales since I was selected as the Conservative Candidate on 7 November. My thirty years of experience as a family lawyer has meant that I have dealt with many of the issues facing today’s society. I have represented many people with the assistance of Legal Aid. I am particularly interested in supporting young and vulnerable families and the elderly.

In addition to trying to meet as many people as possible in Derbyshire Dales on the doorsteps, on the pavements, in the shops and on farms, I have also been in constant touch with County Councillors, District Councillors and Parish Councillors with regards to day to day issues facing the Derbyshire Dales.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/72440-a50d3315-a7b8-49e8-a327-15e9faa16e69.png

I certainly am.  

That’s why I’m standing as an INDEPENDENT candidate ~ to give YOU the choice of a representative in Parliament who can speak powerfully in the best interests of the PEOPLE of Derbyshire Dales – and NOT Big Corporate agendas.

Here are just some of the National issues which you the PEOPLE of Derbyshire Dales have told me are most important to you...   

Cost of Living Crisis  

You may be old enough to remember the assurances which we were given to justify the privatisation of all our key national industries.  That everything would be far more efficient, as well as cheaper, under Big Corporate control.  Yet the price of everything from electricity to food to fuel to travel has skyrocketed in recent years.  Meanwhile, those same Big Corporations are delivering bumper profits for their shareholders.  I was in Portugal recently and a return train fare for a 2.5hour journey, bought on the day, was just 40EUROS !!! A whole breakfast for less than 5EUROS. We have to reclaim control of our key essential industries, and return them back to the PEOPLE.  

Decimation of the NHS  

What was once a nourishing and joyful National Health Service has now been taken over by management consultants, following Big Pharma protocols.  You only have to look at Pfizer’s £100,000,000,000 profits in 2022 to realise the extent to which Big Corporations are draining monies from the PEOPLE worldwide.  Yet, somehow, those same Big Pharma companies have been relieved of any liability for harms caused by their products.  We, the PEOPLE, are left footing the huge (and growing) bill for the burgeoning number of compensation claims resulting from the experimental, not-fully-tested, novel MRNA technology injections, rushed through in 2020.  What’s truly needed is a restoration of the vitality of the Nation ~ combined with embracing natural healing protocols. A return of the heart into our NHS.    

Threat of WW3  

Did YOU agree to support Israel in its massacre of innocent women and children in Palestine? And were you as outraged as I was to discover that earlier this year Rishi Sumac agreed to send a further £2,500,000,000 of OUR money in funding to Ukraine – on top of the £4,600,000,000 which has already been paid to them?  And now there is talk of military conscription for our children, advice to keep a stock of tinned food 'in case of emergency' and the very real prospect of becoming embroiled in WorldWar3 and the threat of nuclear war.  If anything, Keir Starmer is even more Authoritarian than Rishi Sunak.  Let’s cease our involvement in endless overseas conflicts and prioritise our resources on looking after the PEOPLE of the UK.   

Watch my video commentaries on many of these key issues at www.rachelelnaugh.com/Love-Derbyshire-Dales

Here are just some of the Local issues which you the PEOPLE of Derbyshire Dales have told me are most important to you...   

Supporting our Farmers to Thrive  

Farming is one of the key sectors underpinning our area.  Yet our farmers are suffering from excessive DEFRA rules and regulations, combined with rising costs and lack of access to capital. As your INDEPENDENT MP for Derbyshire Dales I will be a powerful voice for radical transformation in all the ways we can value and support our farming community.  No Farmers = No Food.  Watch my video interview of local farmers at www.rachelelnaugh.com/Love-Derbyshire-Dales [coming soon]   

Embracing Tourism and Tourists  

Around 5million visitors flood into Derbyshire Dales every year to reconnect with Nature.  Yet very little has been done to support the infrastructure required to manage such a huge annual influx of people.  Let’s fully embrace all our guests to the area!  Let’s find innovative ways to take cars off the road by restoring the railways to the region.  And let’s creatively manage the number of second and holiday homes (which are ripping the heart and soul out of many local communities) - while ensuring there is ample guest accommodation.  Watch my video interview re: Restoring the Railways at www.rachelelnaugh.com/Love-Derbyshire-Dales [coming soon]   

Restoring Heart and Soul to Derbyshire Dales  

The draconian regime of Peak District National Park ‘Authority’ has unfortunately had the effect of turning the area into a Museum.  None of the great architectural wonders created by the Victorians (which are now listed buildings and conservation areas) would ever have been given permission had PDNPA existed at the time.  What’s needed is an innovative and visionary overhaul which both honours landowners Common Law rights and the natural environment, whilst also ensuring that local people can enjoy affordable housing.  People are PART of Nature!  Watch my video interrogation of PDNPA CEO Phil Mulligan at www.rachelelnaugh.com/Love-Derbyshire-Dales    

 As your INDEPENDENT MP I will host fortnightly public meetings so that we can debate all the key issues YOU are facing.  As a highly experienced public speaker I will then powerfully voice your concerns/needs in Parliament, whilst ensuring that at all times I act and vote in the best interests of the PEOPLE of Derbyshire Dales.

 Your vote CAN make a difference! 

Imagine if everyone disillusioned with Politics and Politicians voted for an INDEPENDENT candidate in the General Election?

Together, we can make 4 July 2024 INDEPENDENT’S DAY !!!

Mocky is tackling the issues that affect residents, he has been fighting for improved amenities and infrastructure such as dentists, schools and GP surgeries and lobbying for a new minor injuries unit at Didcot Community Hospital.

Also, he wants to enhance the connectivity between our towns and villages by improving cycle lanes and by having better public transport links.



Mocky lives in Didcot with his wife and two young daughters. Mocky is a Chartered Marketer, a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Marketing.

The county of Yorkshire is very close to my heart. My mum's side of the family have lived and worked in Yorkshire for several generations and my family hails from the Leeds, Bradford and Hull areas. Some of my most cherished childhood memories are of weekends and holidays spent with family visiting towns, museums, historical sites and outdoor spaces across Yorkshire.

I have been heavily involved in community and volunteer work throughout my adult life, twice as a governor of both a local secondary and primary school, and as a trustee of a charity which owns and manages an historic house, park and gardens near to my home. As a huge sports fan, a particular highlight of my volunteerism was my role as an Olympic Gamesmaker in 2012!

I am passionate about green issues and tackling climate change, and as a dad to 3 young kids a key priority for me is maintaining and safeguarding local parks and green spaces (particularly in urban areas), something so important for the mental and physical health and wellbeing of residents.

Like many people across the United Kingdom I'm experiencing longer wait times for NHS medical and dental treatment, and the daily challenges of soaring energy bills, high food prices, rising mortgage interest rates and astronomical inflation rates that are eroding my savings and sending the cost of living sky rocketing. All of these issues have been caused by years of Tory mismanagement of our economy and under investment in our public services. I am a long time supporter and campaigner for the Liberal Democrats, and in May 2022 I stood as a candidate in the local council elections.

Nicola has long experience in manufacturing and, more recently, has embarked on a career as an NHS professional. 
Nicola is a well-known campaigner who is very active in taking up local issues on behalf of residents.
She has fought changes to HRI for over 15 years! Firstly, when a Labour Government down graded the Maternity unit and began the series of attempts by Government to reduce the HRI to a cottage hospital which is totally unsuitable and unacceptable to Huddersfield and the Colne Valley.
Nicola is closely involved in the community life of the Colne Valley and is always ready to help individual residents with their problems and concerns.
The Colne Valley absolutely depends on good roads to enable residents and businesses thrive. The potholed roads that are endured are the consequence of under investment by Government, as well as Kirklees Labour choosing not to provide sufficient funding for basic repairs to keep our roads safe. The Lib Dems proposed an extra £1m every year to help mend our roads but Labour refused to do so.
And then there is the constant issue that the Council under Labour appears unable to understand. This is that roads in the hills of the Colne Valley suffer more and more often from below zero temperatures and therefore need to be gritted more often. There are simple solutions using basic technology that will identify when roads need to be gritted but Labour seem incapable of appreciating its importance.
Introducing car park charges in Marsden and Slaithwaite is another blow for the local economy. Many businesses depend on visitors trade and local people dropping by for a mini shop. Charging to park will put these businesses at risk.
there's much that needs to be done. Nicola has the energy and commitment to provide the real leadership that the Colne Valley needs.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/553bb2d2b9c95afe74c5d338.png

Lisa was motivated to move in to politics when Mole Valley became the target of unwelcome interest from the oil exploration industry which further threatens the climate, Green Belt, and the air and land around our homes. The possible risks of this extractive industry have become even more apparent with the recent earthquake swarms that have already caused damage to homes and brought worry to residents. Lisa has worked to improve cycling and walking infrastructure and accessibility, with the intention of making walking and cycling a feasible travel option for any member of the community. An 800 signature petition triggered initiation of upgrading of the deteriorated pavement along the A217 to national standards for shared use, bringing it back in to use for those wishing to have an alternatine to car use. Lisa believes passionately that the key to a positive future is through strong and caring local communities. Protecting and promoting local trades, businesses and services to create local jobs for local people. Lisa supports a Work From Home culture to reduce the pressure to commute. Less commuting would result in less traffic on our heaving road system, less pollution of our air and a reclamation of the hours spent on the daily commute to a faceless office building. That extra personal time can lead to an increase in loyalty and respect for our home areas, as we get to spend more time in the place we live, with our families. Lisa is also a keen home cook, allotmenter and travels by bike whenever possible.

- Restoring and improving public transport systems
- Promoting better mental and physical health

Caring for our community, our environment and our residents are key priorities for Kent Liberal Democrats. They have never been more important than now as we emerge from the pandemic.

Protecting the natural environment is of huge concern. We have a responsibility to our children to ensure the world they inherit is safe and clean. As County Councillor I will focus on protecting our precious green spaces and encouraging biodiversity. I will ensure new housing/business developments are properly thought out in terms of services and transport; that any new housing is sustainable as well as energy efficient and that the environmental impact of any development is rigorously evaluated. I will also be looking at air quality and ways to improve it in Deal, Walmer and Dover, which are heavily impacted by Channel traffic.

Another area of concern is the level of traffic and speeding. We urgently need to make our streets safer for all. I will actively promote 20mph as the default speed limit in areas outside schools, residential and shopping districts. Better local transport feeds into this and I shall be urging for a fresh focus on improving existing bus routes and developing new ones.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/60763-4ffc4fa3-bedc-4b81-a06f-13ef2cd1e1c0.png

Before moving to Lambeth in 2008, Pete spent 22 years as an engineer in the army and RAF.

Pete is passionate about standing up for local people and protecting their public services. In 2016 he became a candidate in the Gipsy Hill by-election after occupying the Carnegie Library for 10 days. Shortly afterwards he moved into one of the six Lambeth council estates scheduled for demolition and regeneration, to support residents fighting to keep their homes.

Since becoming a Councillor, Pete has worked with residents and Lambeth Officers to improve the quality of housing in the borough. He is well-known as a housing champion, particularly for those in temporary accommodation. Pete is constantly challenging systemic inequality, to ensure all of Lambeth’s residents have equal access not only to housing, but also to jobs, justice, health, and education.

Pete is also committed to tackling the illegally high levels of air pollution in the borough. Air quality is both an environmental and public health emergency. It affects all residents but particularly children, the elderly, and other vulnerable people. He has studied the transformations needed to achieve clean air and carbon neutrality across the borough by 2030, and is committed to implementing these.

In his free time, Pete is a keen runner and cyclist. He has completed more than 150 marathons and ultra-marathons.

I got actively involved in politics in 2014 when I saw how badly the residents of Cressingham Gardens were being treated by Lambeth Council. Their homes were going to be demolished and their councillors just weren't listening to them. I believe all Lambeth's residents have a right to be heard, and to good quality, affordable housing.

No surprise then, my first vote went to the SDP!

Lambeth has been home for fifteen years, as a wife and a mother, I encourage the same values within my family. Like many Liberal Democrats today my activist career began in the wake of the Brexit Referendum. The experience gave me the opportunity to promote liberal values into my community. It was a privilege working with the Streatham team in the 2019 general election campaign, I bundled, phoned, canvassed, coordinated, counted and supported the candidate in her speaking and community engagements. The experience showed me the true value of what can be achieved when you engage with the community. So when Lambeth declared a Climate Emergency in January 2019 I grasped the chance of representing the Party within the ‘Beyond Politics’ group to hold the Council to account, secure a Citizens Assembly & ensure a Climate Action Plan for Lambeth.

I am standing to be your candidate because I want to see that Action Plan implemented - for the health and wellbeing of all within Lambeth. This year’s tragic events have forced another narrative into the public consciousness something close to my heart: Violence against women & girls, I was on the working group who successfully moved the motion at Conference. 

Equally, all too often the safety and wellbeing of young boys and men is overlooked by society. Personal experience has shown me firsthand why it's so important we support boys and men in our community, from a young age to ensure they have the tools not just to survive but to thrive. Lambeth Council must take meaningful action so that everyone in our community can be safe at all times.

As your candidate, I would use my platform to demand this. Working many years in the Fashion industry - for global companies and running my own business has shown it is not enough to care passionately.

It's where I was born, raised, and all my family live there.



But our are is being let down by two chaotic Governments, too busy fighting among themselves, instead of fighting for Dumfries & Galloway. Enough is enough. It's time for change.



Dumfries & Galloway can lead the way in ending the division and decline of the SNP and the Tories by helping elect a Labour government that will make change a reality. The SNP say they want to send a message to Westminster. I want to change the government in Westminster and you can only do that by voting Labour. We can have a Labour MP at the heart of the next Labour Government as well as the heart of our community. For too long Dumfries & Galloway has been the forgotten region.



Polls show Labour can win back the seat. The last time there was a Labour Government (indeed until 2015) Labour held the seat with Russell Brown winning 46% of the vote (no party has achieved this since).



I will fight for action to tackle the cost of living crisis and get the economy back on track, so local people have more money in their pocket, and we can invest in protecting our local NHS.

✔	Former Holyrood and Council candidate Dominic Ashmole selected by membership. ✔	“Time to break with the past, build resilience in our communities, and face a difficult future with solidarity and compassion.” ✔	South Scotland campaign launch attended by co-leader Patrick Harvie and other Green MSPs.

The Scottish Greens have named their candidate for the constituency of Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale in the upcoming UK General Election. Former healthcare technology project manager Dominic Ashmole, who stood previously in the Holyrood and Council elections, was selected following a ballot of party members throughout Dumfries & Galloway, South Lanarkshire and the Scottish Borders.

At a South Scotland campaign launch in Tweedbank last weekend, Mr Ashmole said:

“I’m grateful to party members for this new opportunity to represent the Greens. When I stood for the Council in 2022, our vote share trebled to more than 16%. I believe we can build on that momentum and send a serious message to Westminster.” 

“Many voters have lost faith in the traditional parties. They don’t want a government that blames refugees and abandons climate action. Nor can they support others who continue promoting false hopes and a reckless growth agenda that has undermined the Earth’s capacity to sustain life.”

“Greens recognise that to live through these times, we must move beyond a global system that is fuelled by exploitation and consumerism, and controlled by the super-rich.”

“Last election, the Conservatives only narrowly beat the SNP here, and voters might assume it’s still a two horse race. But both of those parties have massively lost support since then.”  

“So I'm asking voters to back a dark, Green horse. Let's shock the system that is failing us. Let's make this election about us setting out on a new path. Because we will need to turn to each other as we live through the difficult times the political elites have led us into.” 

“A vote for the Greens is for the courage to break with the past, to build resilience in our communities, and to face a difficult future with solidarity and compassion.”

Mr Ashmole was speaking at a South Scotland campaign launch attended by Scottish Greens Co-Leader Patrick Harvie MSP, Maggie Chapman MSP (Justice, Equality, Human Rights and Economy), and Ariane Burgess MSP (Communities, Land Reform, Housing and Rural Affairs).",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/73626/a3ce9427-2824-4032-b406-e4be75726378.png

Politically, I have always been left of centre and have been politically active throughout my life. I joined the Green Party in 2022 and have supported the local Green candidates in the recent May 2023 Local Elections in both Amptill and St Albans, whilst standing myself in Dunstable North. It is clear to me that we need an alternative to the present two-party monopoly which has governed the country for past 100 years. Our present ‘first past the post’ system is not conducive to the greater plurality in political approaches required at this pivotal moment in time and it is for this reason, I believe in a fairer proportional representation system, one which has been shown to lead to more long-term decision making amongst our European neighbours. Our present short-term politics seems to me to only serve the governing party rather than to be in the best interests of the country. I am a believer that the state has a major role to play in both regulating our neoliberal market economy as well as investing in our public services, and it is for this reason I support a progressive taxation policy in which we raise much needed funds to ensure we have a society which looks after the many rather than a select few. Equally, the challenges posed by climate change also offers an opportunity for us to invest in low carbon approaches and technologies which will not only allow us to meet our climate change goals but can help us to become a more dynamic economic power, one which is less dependent on the financial services sector and on consumerism to support economic growth. This cannot happen unless we are prepared to invest in our future. Such investment will not be cheap and requires the political leadership which the Greens can provide. People are, naturally, apprehensive over change but the Greens have a vision, a strategy and a message that such investment is not only good for our society but for the planet also. We are the only political party which is prepared to take the tough decisions to invest in low carbon approaches and technologies, which will result in better insulation for our homes, a reduction in our dependence on fossil fuels, an improvement in the quality of our water and air, and an improvement in public transport. The other major political parties have jettisoned their green credentials for political expediency and short-term success. We can no longer afford to continue in this vein, an approach which leads to delay after delay in making the bold decisions which are required to improve the health of our country, and our planet, for future generations. Our children, rightly, will not forgive us unless we take steps now to implement the changes required which will allow them to have a brighter future. This includes forming closer alliances with our European partners and revisiting the disastrous decision to leave the European Union. It is our responsibility to act and be bold enough to say that the present political consensus is not working.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/116855/920ccdf4-78af-441b-a01d-b8ca6af5a9b0.png

2) Sort out the economy It feels like Britain is broken - global events would be bad enough even without Conservative mismanagement. It’s time to end the cost of living crisis and end the unfairness and waste in the system.

Sammy is now one of Northern Ireland’s best known politicians. He was educated at Methodist College, Belfast. He went on to graduate in Economics and Politics from Queens University, Belfast and then Stranmillis Teaching College. Sammy took up a teaching post at Grosvernor Grammar School where he was to become Head of Economics and Assistant Chief Examiner for A-level Economics in Northern Ireland.

Sammy began his life in politics as the Democratic Unionist Party’s Press Officer and in 1981 he was elected as a DUP Councillor to Belfast City Council, a position he held until 2010. Sammy became the first person from the DUP Party to serve as Lord Mayor of Belfast in 1986/1987 and then again in 2000/2001.

Sammy was elected to the Northern Ireland Forum in May 1996 for the Constituency of East Belfast (1996-1998) and went on to represent this area again after he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly upon its creation in June 1998. In the 2003 Assembly elections, Sammy stood as a candidate in the East Antrim constituency alongside fellow DUP candidates, George Dawson and David Hilditch. All three were successful in the election and served as Members of the Legislative Assembly.   

On 9 June 2008, Sammy became part of the Assembly Executive as Minister for the Environment. His appointment and tenure as Environment Minister were heavily criticised by Environmental Groups because Sammy believes that climate change is not man-made and the myth of climate change is based on dodgy science not proven. He is not a fan of the Green Lobby who try to scaremonger people with their alarmist views. 

In June 2009 after an Executive reshuffle, Sammy became the Minister for Finance and Personnel. He was replaced as the Minister of Finance and Personnel, again after a planned reshuffle by Simon Hamilton MLA in 2013. During his time in the Northern Ireland Assembly Sammy also served on the Northern Policing Board and the Education Committee. 

In the 2005 Westminster Elections Sammy defeated Roy Beggs of the Ulster Unionist Party to become the Member of Parliament for East Antrim with 49.6% of the vote.  

In 2016 coming up to the referendum on Brexit, Sammy campaigned vigorously for the United Kingdom to leave the EU and believes that the country would be better served being in charge of our own finances, trade and immigration laws. He serves on the Brexit Committee at Westminster.

Away from politics, Sammy is a keen motorbike enthusiast, a keen gardener, he is an ardent reader and is well known for his sense of humour.

· Campaign for increased funding for rural schools, so that our children can receive an excellent education where they live.



· Fight to bring back NHS dentistry to our towns, with mobile units for our villages, because access to dental care shouldn't be a privilege.



· Work to improve public transport connections, helping people to get around our widespread region and opening up job opportunities.



· Push for financial support for our farmers, who have been harmed by Brexit, protecting local agriculture and our food supply.



· Support policies that will help to secure our national future, such as increasing NATO spending and backing British steel.



· Strongly advocate for an Online Harms Bill that tackles internet safety issues head-on and gives police the tools to make young people safer in the digital world.

At all levels, from Primary schools through to Further and Higher Education, children’s futures are being played with for ideological gain.

During the pandemic, when I stepped back from work to help my children learn at home, I got involved in fundraising for my children's school and became a parent governor. I also help supervise children on school trips.

When I talk to other school governors from across Hampshire at training events, I hear a lot of the same desperate stories. Parents are waiting years for suitable school places, children and young people cannot access mental health support, budgets are squeezed and headteachers are struggling to recruit and retain the quality staff they need to tackle educational disadvantage across the county. Schools are literally falling apart and it is no wonder when we have had six Tory Education Secretaries in the last five years.

We need a Labour government to put an end to this chaos and remove barriers to opportunity.

I have stood 4 times now for Reform UK since 2021, making me an experienced Local Politician with a demonstrable track record of engaging with constituents.

A bit about me, I have lived and worked in Eastleigh since 2011 and care deeply about the town and borough I feel lucky enough to call home.

As a taxpayer, I have become increasingly disappointed and frustrated in the quality of public services provided by the Council and its stakeholders.  Once elected, I will work tirelessly to slash unnecessary bureaucracy and red tape to free up money to improve the services we receive from the Council which have been deteriorating year on year.  I will be a challenging, robust voice on the Council something which has been sadly lacking due to the Liberal Democrat monopoly.

The Liberal Democrat controlled Eastleigh Council is on the brink of bankruptcy due to their financial mismanagement over decades which has created thousands of pounds of debt for every single Eastleigh resident.  This needs to stop and I will hold them to account at every opportunity to the benefit of Eastleigh residents.

We all deserve value for money public services that deliver positive, tangible results; be that something as basic as getting our bins emptied on time right through to revitalising the town centre which has very sadly changed beyond all recognition over the last few years; what once used to be a vibrant shopping hub is now a wasteland of empty units.  Eastleigh residents deserve more than the Council is currently delivering.

A particular issue I am very troubled by is the rising level of violent crime, anti-social behaviour and drug dealing in the town which I believe has not been helped by the closure of our police station that not only provided a safe and accessible place to residents needing to use it, its geographical prominence undoubtedly acted as a deterrent against crime in the vicinity.  We have the right to feel safe in our town with a visible police presence to provide that comfort and assurance, not a remote office on the outskirts that you cannot walk into without making an appointment.

A bit more about me, I currently work at Aviva Health in Eastleigh as Executive Assistant to the CEO also sitting on the Senior Leadership Team.  Previously, I worked in the NHS at Omega House for almost five years, supporting a Clinical Commissioning Group Board which gave me a working insight into how public services are organised and delivered… there is a lot of work to do.  I also worked for the Commissioning Support Unit at Omega House in the Freedom of Information Team dealing with requests from members of the public, Councillors and MP's.

In 2015, I worked at Prysmian in their centenary year, supporting the CEO and Senior Management Team and whilst there was involved in organising a UK Trade and Industry visit. 

I have a proven track record of representing constituents having been Chair of the UK Employee Forum representing some 4,000 colleagues whilst working at Quilter in Southampton.

I have also formed and lead a local Leaseholder Action Group on my housing development fighting for much needed changes in Leasehold law via the National Leasehold Campaign who are demanding equal rights for Leaseholders that other homeowners enjoy.  This role came about following being fraudulently ripped off and by our former Managing Agent.  I am passionate in driving change for Leaseholders as a result and am developing and crafting Leasehold policy for Reform UK as their expert in this field.

My strongly held personal values coupled with my practical working experience, gained in both public sector organisations and professional services businesses, including law and financial services, affords me the knowledge, experience  and skills to properly represent you as a Councillor and Member of Parliament.

So, if you are hungry for impactful and meaningful change, are disillusioned with the shenanigans of the main parties or just feel politically homeless, why not consider voting for me. 

Its time to start voting for what we want rather than what we fear.  There is no longer any difference between the Conservatives and Labour, only Reform UK can deliver the changes needed to Save Britain.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/77793/cf7c8758-14f8-46eb-b97d-408b12908a23.png

Standing up for the economy • support local businesses to be successful and sustainable.

Standing up for the community • Help the community transition towards a carbon zero future. • Fight for a green transport infrastructure that alleviates the stress on our roads.

Having lived in Croydon most of his life, he moved to Woodmansterne in 2016.  He is a Domestic Energy Assessor and a committed campaigner. He has stood for parliament on four occasions and twice for the Greater London Assembly constituency of Sutton and Croydon. In 2009 he founded the Stop The (Beddington) Incinerator campaign. Over the years he has continuously opposed this dangerous development. and in 2013 he took the Lib Dem controlled Sutton Council to the High Court, risking his house in the process.

ON OVERDEVELOPMENT

When looking at posts on the Next Door web site, I sense that residents in Chipstead, Kingswood and Woodmansterne are very keen to avoid senseless infill development which gradually changes the appearance of an area.

Green Party councillors in Reigate and Banstead Council sit on various committees of the Local Authority and try to shape policy implementation in a fairer and more sustainable direction. Greens sit on Planning Committee for instance where we are keen to avoid overdevelopment - protecting the green belt but also the green character of many areas is a core value. However, Greens recognise this often means there is infilling such as back garden schemes which over time changes an area's character and quality, as has been happening at places like Nork.

Greens are also forced to navigate Government imposed targets for housing numbers (which are based on out of date statistics) in the Local Plan whilst at the same time pushing hard for for truly affordable homes ie Council Housing or socially rented provision across our Borough. 

As Greens have to work with the policies set out in the Local Plan we cannot reject things outright but we do ensure that where for instance back garden sites are proposed for development these are very carefully scrutinised - layout and design notably density, loss of trees and biodiversity, building lines and so forth - to avoid overbearing and cramped development impacting on the community. We favour the concept of the 20 minute neighbourhood too (now in the NPPF) to encourage access to local amenities on foot and by bike ie other than the car. Avoiding unnecessarily high density infill schemes in such accessible areas is important since existing minimum standards would otherwise require high parking provision, or worse, generate off street parking and potential neighbour conflict. 

ON ROADS

I live on a road which suffers from potholes. Potholes need to be fixed properly and that means not waiting until the whole road needs resurfacing. I will make sure broken streetlamps, blocked drains and flytipping also get sorted.

ON ADDRESSING THE COST-OF-LIVING AND CLIMATE CRISES

More help to insulate homes is a simple win/win policy here.

The next election is our chance to end the austerity, chaos and mismanagement of the last 14 years. But if we want a better Thanet, we need a Labour government, and we need to elect a Labour MP right here in East Thanet. It's a big task but together we can do it.



Whether born or drawn here, people love this place, and rightly so --- it has so much going for it; its landscape, its history and above all its people. But Thanet has borne the brunt of rapid change and Tory neglect. Our NHS is on life support, with people struggling to get a GP appointment or register for a dentist. Spiralling house prices and unregulated AirBnB. Our seas and rivers polluted for profit. Now with inflation and interest rates affecting family finances, many are struggling more than ever. It doesn't have to be like this.



That's why we need a Labour government.

One that will bring down our bills, paid for by a windfall tax on the oil and gas giants.

One that will end the shortage of nurses and doctors by doubling the number of medical school places.

One that will make our streets safer, hiring more police officers in Thanet, paid for by cutting the Tories' wasteful spending.

And one that will ensure we have a stronger economy with good jobs powered by cleaner, cheaper energy

We need real change at Westminster. I can’t sit back and watch as the main parties roll back on climate commitments, devastate our public services, and stir up hatred within our communities. I want to get Green ideas, policies and values into the debate. 

The UK is the sixth wealthiest country in the world, but for too many it doesn’t feel that way. Decades of Tory governments have worsened inequality and brought our public sector to its knees. Labour promises little change, refusing to cap bankers’ bonuses or bring in wealth taxes. The SNP council tax freeze means less local services for communities in Scotland. 

Different choices are possible. The Scottish Greens stand for greener, fairer policies that make life better for the majority and protect our shared planet, instead of concentrating wealth and power at the very top.

Voting Green sends a message to other parties: people want change and are willing to vote for it. We want real action on the climate emergency, with everyone supported through the transition. We want to share the wealth that already exists. In Edinburgh East and Musselburgh there is huge demand for investment in social and affordable housing; insulation and low-carbon heating; local green spaces and efficient public transport; health and social care; leisure centres and libraries; and natural flood management. 

With Labour set to be the next UK Government on the basis of English votes alone, in Scotland we can vote for our values. How else will we get the change we so desperately need?

The Holyrood parties, from the Greens to the Conservatives, argue about independence, but they unite to endorse the dramatic cultural changes that are damaging our society.

It doesn’t matter which Holyrood Party you vote for……

Kids are taught that they can choose whether to be a boy or a girl, while a flawed philosophy of education leads to a breakdown of discipline and, inevitably, declining academic standards.  The state increasingly sees itself as the guardian of children, ensuring that parents are adhering to their narrow philosophy of child-rearing.

Differences between men and women are regarded as problems to eliminate rather than expressions of diversity to celebrate.

The state claims it wants to help families yet offers no help to couples where one parent wants to devote more of their time to their children.

Abortion continues unquestioned.  No party opposes assisted suicide.

The breakdown of family structure is not recognised as the source of countless problems.

The value of marriage in producing stable families is dismissed as archaic.

Freedom of speech is constantly being restricted, and democracy is therefore undermined.

Have the mainstream parties learnt that they can ignore our opinions because we will keep voting for them as they trample our deepest principles? It’s time to stand up for what we believe in.

As a trade union rep in the energy sector, I have seen the power of collective action and how ordinary workers, standing together, can achieve great things. That is what motivated me to stand for Scottish Labour.





For too long the Liberal Democrats have taken Edinburgh West for granted and the SNP have tried to use it as a political football. All the while, our roads crumble, our schools are over capacity and our bus services are cut.





Edinburgh West needs a party that will stand up for everybody's interests and give people a voice in government.





It's only Labour who can offer the change we need.

Following year-on-year funding cuts from the Conservatives, nationally and locally, Essex became the country’s lowest-funded police force.

Consequently, victims of crime don’t receive the support they rightly expect, and the wider community doesn’t have the reassuring police service it needs.

As Essex’s Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner, I will put our communities at the heart of our strategy. To reduce crime and support victims better, every part of Essex needs to pull together: the police working with local councils, voluntary organisations and residents to tackle crime at the roots, not simply clean up afterwards.

As a Liberal Democrat I believe in actions that actually cut crime, not Conservative slogans that sound tough but actually fail. For almost 10 years Essex Conservatives have cut funding for youth services, completely undermining attempts to divert young people away from gangs, crime and anti-social behaviour.

It’s pointless wasting funds on parts of the criminal justice system that don’t work. Two effective ways to change this are: adopting a public-health-first approach to tackle drug abuse, and using restorative justice to intervene and divert people away from the criminal justice system earlier.

As the PFCC, I will do both of these and invest the savings in police time in increasing community policing.

Our fire service plays a vital role that goes far beyond fighting fires. As the Commissioner, I will ensure fire and policing services work together, including a public education program to reduce hoax calls.

Finally, I recognise that our police officers and firefighters have some of the toughest jobs in public service and will ensure they have the training and support needed to tackle the challenges they face every day.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/75124-08dc116e-1871-4dc6-9800-db8f044cd393.png

Originally from Northern Ireland, Brent made Breaston and Erewash his home 23 years ago and is passionate about maintaining and improving the area while also preserving the history and unique local culture.  He says: “Erewash has been my home for two decades; I have lived here for 23 years and I’ve worked here as a teacher for 20 of those years in the same local school. Perhaps, most importantly to me, I am raising my family here: my children go to school here; we use the parks and local amenities; we experience the same issues as every other Erewash resident; and I am completely invested in the long-term future of the whole of the borough.”

I have been an active member of the Green Party since 2014 when I was made aware of local issues such as fracking and HS2. I witnessed first-hand how the current political establishment failed us. I stood as a parliamentary candidate in 2019 and doubled the Green vote. I stood as a Derbyshire County Council candidate in 2021 and beat Labour into second becoming the official opposition. Since then I have continued to work hard across the borough campaigning for residents on housing, education, transport and social justice issues. 

As candidate for the Green Party, I am looking forward to holding the current government party to account and to address the opposition parties on matters which have affected our borough in recent years. I think you will agree that Erewash requires systematic change politically, economically and environmentally to improve quality of life for each, and every, Erewash resident.  Our local manifesto is simple –

• To properly fund ALL local front-line services.

We will reverse the austerity of the last 14 years and not just patch up what is broken by ensuring all have access to vital social services. This includes quality social care, protection of our hospital and all of the emergency services. Services need to work together more collaboratively as they used to and more connected to the community they serve. Not only reverse cuts to Ilkeston hospital but expand the number of beds and reinstate the drop in centre. Our NHS is that, ours and must remain so, it can’t be allowed to slide further into managed decline. 

• A stronger local economy, with the right job in the right place for the right person.

Regeneration of both Ilkeston and Long Eaton High streets, by working with and supporting local businesses to offer sustainable and meaningful employment with living wages and a work life balance which maximises the potential of the area and not a race to the bottom. We need “bottom up” development that helps up our community not “top down” which helps the already wealthy. We have too many suffering in our community from poverty, too many failed by false promises of “levelling up” which have not been delivered and too many who suffered not only during austerity, covid but this imposed cost of living crisis. We must prepare for the next Industrial Revolution and AI, the Erewash Green Party has been at the forefront of Green policy on AI and we need to ensure the Green Industrial Revolution starts where the 1st Industrial Revolution started. 

• Improve our education system and outcomes

We need to unlock the potential of our youth and not continue the “Brain Drain” in losing our brightest and best. Therefore, we must invest in local education and in skills to help create an innovative workforce.  The current underfunded of education system is going to not only hurt the nation but the social consequences are going to cost us in the long run. We need to improve the poor social mobility rates in Erewash, every child in the borough should have the same life chances, every child should start their lessons with a full stomach and be taught by a specialist teacher who can meet their needs in a safe environment. 

• The right housing in the right place for the right person.

We do not need more housing on Greenbelt but more regeneration of our existing Brownfield sites. Erewash has hundreds of empty properties, retail and industrial units. These brownfield sites are more appropriate for redevelopment before using the Greenbelt.  We need more social housing, affordable housing and homes for an older population which the current census data shows. Too often the developer is king and gets to choose where the housing goes, this is regardless of service access of impact on the existing community, we would end this. Also, when houses are built they must be built to a high standard and not on floodplains. 

• Future proof Erewash for the climate change crisis

The clock is ticking on environmental policy reform; we will make sure that residents of Erewash have a voice in protecting our community, our local environment and way of life. We need rewilding, meadow seeding and reforestation not only to improve our environment but to protect us from climate change. We will take radical steps to help prevent and protect our residents against flooding, hydraulic fracking, large scale building projects from the inland Freeport and any HS2 developments while conserving and regenerating our precious and beautiful greenbelt. 

• Clean up and enhance our local environment

We have the 5th worst sewage polluted river in the country in the River Derwent and 11th in the River Erewash. In the event of flooding, we will be having this effluence not only in the likes of West Park but also potentially in homes. We need to clean up our local waterways.  We have air quality issues with our proximity to the M1, we need a green lung along this corridor and ensure we encourage a decarbonisation of transport and encourage great use of bus transport to reduce emissions.  We need more Green appropriate infrastructure in both local energy generation. We will fight the scourge of fly tipping and reform waste services to ensure greater reduce, re-use and recycling. 

• More community involvement in safer communities

There is a disconnect between the political establishment and the community, voting rates in local elections reflect this. The lack of engagement by our MP is a low. We would therefore look to involve more advocates in our management of our community. Together we can solve community problems of anti-social behaviour, crime, litter, fouling and empower more to invest civically in their communities.

The binary politics of Conservatives and Labour has failed Erewash and failed the country. They are too much party first and people second. I believe in a different mantra of “service above self”. It would be a privilege to represent all the people of my ward and my constituency, a privilege I would not take advantage of for my own gain. We are not all the same in politics, vote Green and vote Brent.

The unfairness I felt about this drove me to challenge the barriers that I faced as a Black woman, and I was honoured and privileged to be elected as the Member of Parliament for Erith and Thamesmead on 13th December 2019.

All my life I've fought for local people, speaking truth to power on behalf of some of the most vulnerable in our communities. I represented Erith on Bexley Council, speaking up for our area at the town hall and helping to lead the Labour group of Bexley councillors as deputy leader and spokesperson for education. I worked at the Greater London Authority (GLA), supporting our London Assembly members to effectively represent the people of London. In the aftermath of the Grenfell tragedy, I led community engagement work for the GLA and Mayor Sadiq Khan, making sure that the people of London were heard to stop anything like this from ever happening again. Before I was elected as an MP, I led resident engagement for a local authority, ensuring the voices of residents helped to shape local services.

After becoming an MP, I was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to Labour's then Shadow Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), Luke Pollard MP, and later Parliamentary Private Secretary to the then Shadow Chancellor, Anneliese Dodds MP. In October 2020 I joined the Shadow Treasury Team as Shadow Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury.

I'm so proud to serve as the MP for Erith and Thamesmead, turning anger against injustice into action, taking our shared issues to Parliament and challenging the Government on the most important issues our community faces including housing, health, transport and climate change. I go to work every day with my constituent's concerns in my mind and I'm already delivering results for local people, on everything from providing help to access benefits to standing up to the Home Office and fighting for local people in immigration cases.

With a Labour Government, I know we can do so much more. I look forward to campaigning for a fairer, greener and more prosperous future for Britain.

In one word: opportunity.

This is because access to opportunity changed my life. I was born on a council estate to a 14-year-old girl before going into foster care and being adopted by my family. My mum and dad worked exceptionally hard to give me the best upbringing they could. Their support helped me become one of the first in my family to get A Levels, and the very first to go to university.

The problem is, far too many people don't get that second chance. So I’m standing for Parliament to help people in our area - which I’m passionate about as a local councillor - and address the root causes of problems, help fix the system, and keep knocking down barriers to opportunity.

It’s why I’ve also dedicated my career to education, adult learning, and apprenticeships. I’m currently an executive director at the charity UCAS - the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service - which helps over a million people each year get the support they need to make life-changing decisions. I therefore see the transformative power of education every day, including in our area, where the number of schools rated by Ofsted as ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ has risen from 69% in 2010 to 93% today. We must get this to 100%.

My proudest achievement at UCAS has been driving forward our expansion into apprenticeships for the first time. Academic study works for many, but not all. It's been great to see job boosting and life changing apprenticeships expand significantly in our area, with nearly 5,000 new apprenticeships started in Esher and Walton alone since 2010.

As well as a passion for education, I want to see business flourish in our area.

This includes smaller, local, independent companies, like my dad’s. He sold machinery and parts to factories, and I saw the extra mile he went to keep his shop going: bending over backwards for customers, supporting his staff, and working weekends to keep the ship afloat. Businesses like these are often the backbone of our high street and our economy, as well as making up the supply chains of larger firms. We must back local businesses and entrepreneurs - and critically, cut the taxes they pay so they can hire more local people and invest in the company.

Despite the best intentions, I think government and regulation can get in the way of business too often. I believe passionately we need to make it easier for companies to grow, to employ and train people, and to innovate.

I worked for our MP Ben Bradshaw, supporting Exeter residents and organisations, and I stood as the Labour candidate for East Devon in the 2015 general election. I'm now running to be Exeter's next MP, hoping to take over from Ben as he retires after over 25 years. I grew up under a Tory Government, and from an early age I was determined to change the fundamental unfairness I saw around me - my local comprehensive school was decaying and we shared textbooks between three in a class; the council house I grew up in was cold and too small for our large family, and was unsuitable for my disabled sister.

When Labour came to power, this all started to change, and my family gained new opportunities - we moved into a purpose-built new council house, and I was later the first in my family to go to university.

After another 14 years of Tory Government, we're back to where we were in 1997 - and worse. The services we all depend on are overstretched. I want to work with residents to work for an inclusive, prosperous and fair Exeter - where everyone has the opportunity of a warm and secure home and no-one is forced into homelessness; where people can get a decent well-paid job, put food on the table, and access the best education for their kids. I believe in an NHS in Exeter and across the country that is well-funded, patient-focused, and at the forefront of diagnostics and treatment pathways, with the RD&E able to lead the transformation of health and care in the city and region.

Exeter is a great city, and it succeeds under Labour. With a Labour MP and a Labour Council, the city continues to grow in economic prosperity and civic pride.

My father a farmer and my mother a civil servant.  I went to Larbert Village primary school and Larbert High School then on to Oatridge Agricultural College.  I met my wife Cheryl in 2015 and we wed in May 2023.

Since I was old enough to be useful I have farmed in Larbert, Denny and other parts of the Falkirk area.  When I left college I worked full time on the family farm, becoming a partner in the farm business with my Dad.  Since Dad sadly passed away in 2018 I have run the farm business on my own account, expanding it with the addition of more livestock and rented and contract-farmed ground.

We are a mixed animal/arable operation but have diversified into other enterprises such as selling pre-fabricated buildings and internal stabling.  Our contract winter maintenance business lasted until high fuel costs made it uneconomic.

I may only be 30 but having been brought up on the farm and having been lucky enough to have had a father who gave me responsibility for running the farm has given me an excellent grasp of the business and personal struggles of the real world. This is something our current batch of MP’s seem to be severely lacking!

Unlike the Conservative and Lib Dems candidates, I have lived with my family in our new constituency since before I was selected as a parliamentary candidate.

I am proud to call Farnham and Bordon my home. My wife and I love raising our three kids here and our eldest attends our local state primary school.

But after 14 years of the Conservatives and Lib Dems failing on many of the big decisions, I cannot sit on the sidelines.

The country and our local area needs a fresh start.

I offer a new approach. I am a barrister not a career politician -- this is the first time I have run for public office.

I have the energy, ideas, and experience to get things done.

Raised by a single mum in Edinburgh, I know first hand the freedom and opportunity which opens up when the government takes an active role in supporting families and young people.

I have spent my legal career standing up for working people and fighting to protect the rule of law.

As an education campaigner I have worked with government and business to give young people the skills they need to be confident communicators and respectful citizens.

I am asking for your vote at the General Election because I want to serve our community and bring integrity, honesty, and courtesy back into politics.

And, I can win here! The Sunday Times/Survation 'Spring Mega Poll' shows Labour are just 4% behind the Tories, and 5% ahead of the Lib Dems in Farnham and Bordon.

I want to make sure that we have more affordable and social rent housing in the area, with the right infrastructure to support it, so everyone has the chance to have a place they can call home.



I am passionate about the environment, and have campaigned on this issue for many years. I also believe we need a ""just transition,"" to meet our net zero targets, so everyone can access cheaper energy bills, up-skill to greener jobs, decarbonise their homes. I want to see better public transport system, that is affordable, accessible and reliable, more active travel routes that inspire and encourage more people to happily integrate a range of travel options in to their journeys.



As a musician , I'm also a strong advocate for the arts and for example have performed at the Faversham Hop Festival numerous times.

My journey has been one of dedication, resilience, and unwavering commitment to serving our community and country.   A Proud Military Background   My story began in Punjab, India, and in 2003, I moved to the UK in search of greater opportunities and to contribute to a nation I admired. In 2007, I joined the British Army, serving valiantly in the Royal Army Dental Corps. Over nearly eight years of service, I learned the core values of discipline, integrity, and selfless commitment. Even after my active service, I continued to contribute as a reservist while successfully running my own business.   Fighting for Our Rights: Protests and Activism   I have always believed in standing up for what is right. In August 2022, as the cost of living crisis hit hard, I launched a hunger strike at Reading Station. For seven days, I protested to highlight the struggles faced by countless families grappling with soaring living costs, food poverty, and rising homelessness. This act of solidarity drew national attention, but unfortunately, it was met with silence from the Conservative government.   Not one to be deterred, I continued my activism. When the Labour Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, pushed through the ULEZ expansion despite widespread opposition, I knew I had to act. In August 2023, I led a week-long hunger strike at Uxbridge Station to protest this punitive policy. This protest garnered international coverage and support from numerous like-minded activists. Together, we demonstrated that we will not stand idle while unfair policies burden our working class.   Why I Joined Politics   Through these experiences, it became clear to me that our current political leaders have lost touch with the real struggles of everyday people. The traditional parties have failed us—The Conservatives have led us towards financial ruin, and Labour's policies threaten to bankrupt our nation further. The systemic issues within our political system require a new approach, one grounded in reality and committed to genuine reform.   I joined Reform UK because I believe in their mission to restore fairness, accountability, and common sense to our government. We need policies that support our working class, ensure financial stability, and uphold our national values. Reform UK stands for cutting government waste, lowering taxes, and making work pay. We have a comprehensive plan to fix the NHS, increase police numbers, and restore public safety.   A Vision for Feltham and Heston   As your MP, I will bring the same dedication and resolve to Parliament that I have shown throughout my career. I will fight for affordable housing, fair wages, and a robust healthcare system. I will ensure that our police are adequately funded and equipped to keep our streets safe. And most importantly, I will listen to you, the people of Feltham and Heston, and make sure your voices are heard.   Join Me in This Fight for Our Future   This election is about more than just choosing a candidate; it's about choosing the direction of our community and our country. On July 4th, vote for a candidate who has proven his commitment to fighting for you.

Guided by the core values of the Green Party, I aim to bring about social and environmental fairness, working for a secure, equitable and sustainable future for all. 

I am not a career politician; I am a local resident, involved in the local community, who understands the daily challenges we face here, from potholes to bus services, doctors to dirty seas. My journey from scientific research to the construction industry has equipped me with the skills and knowledge to advocate effectively for our community. The construction industry’s progress in environmental sustainability demonstrates that what is good for the environment is also good for business and public health.  I am passionate about tackling the climate emergency, biodiversity loss and pollution, both in my professional and personal lives, which other parties are not taking nearly seriously enough, and there are so many other issues affecting local people, including the cost-of-living crisis and our crumbling public services. 

Now, it's time to bring my energy and experience to Parliament. Unlike other candidates who may be tied to party lines, I promise to be your local voice, committed to practical solutions that benefit people and the planet. 

People are desperate for change and the Green Party are the only ones who will represent local people instead of putting party interests first. Vote for me, and together we can build a fair, green future for all.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/107987/3275deba-6a0a-448d-86b2-bcb2ea17ae2d.png

Recruiting over 600 more officers and getting them out on the beat, reopening police stations to the public and sending a clear message – the police are here to fight crime and protect people. 

From funding one of the largest rural policing teams in the country, the new Roads Policing Unit, the Anti-Social Behaviour Target Team, or the Task Forces busting up criminal gangs – the changes and investments I have made are working. 

Lancashire Constabulary have launched two Operations with the extra resources I have made available to deliver the priorities I set of getting tough on antisocial behaviour and to relentlessly target criminal gangs:

1. Since Operation Warrior was launched – over 1,400 gang suspects have been arrested, 286kg of class A&B drugs seized, and over £1million of criminals’ cash taken off them. 

2. Since Operation Centurion was launched – over 14,000 extra hours of foot patrols have taken place in antisocial behaviour hotspots, with over 1,500 stop checks and searches taking place and over 140 repeat offenders arrested. 

But I know there is much more to do. 

That’s why I have committed £1million a year, for the next three years, to recruit even more officers to join the ranks of local neighbourhood teams across Lancashire. It’s why I’ve set out plans to expand the Roads Policing Unit to target ‘boy racers’, and to fund a further rollout of the anti-social behaviour foot patrols. 

But I can only deliver all this if re-elected in May. A vote for me is a vote to continue to focus on the basics, leading the fight against crime.

It is a privilege that I take seriously and strive to do my very best for everyone.
I will support a Conservative Government to negotiate a deep and special partnership between a strong and successful European Union and a United Kingdom that is free to chart its own way in the world. 
The General Election on Thursday, 8th June, is about more than just Brexit. It is about what sort of government we want. About a strong and stable government under Theresa May, governing in the national interest or the alternative. It is about building a prosperous economy which delivers for all; about securing the future of our NHS on a sustainable footing — an NHS that is properly resources and staffed — built on sure foundations that will last. This election is about making sure that our children have the world-class education they deserve, where parents and teachers are in the driving seat and head teachers are free run their schools as their professional consciences dictate. It is about our elderly population living their lives with respect and dignity and about the most vulnerable in our society getting the help, care and support they need. I will work with the Police and Crime Commissioner, Marc Jones, and our Conservative-led County and District Councils to fight for a sustainable and fairer funding settlement for rural parts of the country, like Lincolnshire. 
The Gainsborough Constituency is one of England’s biggest and most rural constituency. I will be your voice championing our struggling village shops, post offices, and amenities. We need to value the immense contribution made by volunteers and farmers to the countryside. I have relentlessly campaigned for better broadband for our area.
I would be honoured to continue my service for all the people of the Gainsborough Constituency.

I grew up in this area and still live here with my family today. My personal journey has been marked by challenges overcome with the help of the very institutions I now aim to protect and enhance. The NHS, our nation's pride, played a pivotal role in saving my life. It's this gratitude and understanding of its value that fuels my drive and commitment to not only safeguard but also improve our healthcare system. My priorities include reducing waiting lists, addressing the gaps in our dentistry services and significantly enhancing the provision of mental health support.



But my vision extends beyond healthcare. Our community deserves a robust foundation to build their lives upon, which starts with addressing our housing crisis. I am dedicated to increasing the availability of new homes and simplifying the journey for first-time buyers to own a home. This is not just about construction; it's about building secure futures.



Growing our economy is another part of my campaign. By attracting new businesses to our area and improving public transport, we not only create job opportunities but also enhance the quality of life for everyone. A robust economy and accessible transportation are key to a thriving community, and I am committed to making sure we can improve the area for us all.



The time for change is now. Our community, our nation, faces unprecedented challenges that demand innovative solutions and decisive leadership. The same old approaches will not suffice. For too long we have been let down by the Conservatives. We need fresh perspectives, driven by lived experiences and an unwavering commitment to the welfare of our people. My pledge to you is to bring this change, to work tirelessly for our community, and to ensure that our future is not just secured, but flourishing through Labour's plan for a decade of national renewal.



I believe together we can win here. It won't be easy but Labour's plan can give us the hope and determination to reclaim and secure Britain's future. A future where healthcare is accessible, where everyone has the opportunity to own a home, where our economy thrives and where our community's voice is not just heard, but acted upon. Together, we can make this vision a reality.



Please do get in touch with me directly through the above contact methods. Together we can win in Gainsborough.

After 14 years of this Conservative Government, our beautiful part of Somerset has been taken for granted and is worse off. With crumbling public services, record high taxes, and nothing but sleaze and scandal from the top, Britain and Glastonbury & Somerton need transformative change.



When I was growing up locally, the last Labour Government made sure my classroom was not overly-crowded, I could see my GP or dentist quickly, and the council was able to fund key local services.



Growing up locally now, my nephews and nieces are facing a different world. Since 2010, Somerset's schools have faced per pupil funding cuts of £118 a year, public satisfaction in our NHS has fallen from record highs under Labour to record lows under the Tories, and Somerset Council is £67 million a year worse off than it was under Labour.



It does not have to be like this.



I am campaigning on Labour's transformative plans for a clean energy industrial revolution, to support our rural economy and sustainable farming, and for restoring ethics and integrity back into our politics.



Only Labour can deliver the transformative change for a fairer, greener future.

The mother of one represents Westgate on the city council and is the cabinet member for community engagement in the newly-elected Liberal Democrat administration running Gloucester City Council.

In her portfolio she has responsibility for the nighttime economy, community engagement and safety, shopmobility, licensing, the armed forces covenant and health, wellbeing and safeguarding.

Rebecca topped the poll in Westgate at the recent local elections in May - just a year after first being elected to the council - and lives in the city close to St Oswald's Priory.

May's elections in Gloucester proved one thing – that the challengers to the Conservatives at the General Election are the Liberal Democrats.

The Lib Dems became the largest party on Gloucester City Council with 17 seats to form the ruling cabinet. They also beat the Conservatives and Labour in the popular vote.

And left the struggling Labour Party with just seven councillors in the city.

Rebecca works for a charity helping people with dementia and has previously worked in social care, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic, helping some of our city’s most vulnerable.

As part of his degree, he spent 16 months studying politics in Paris, which opened his eyes to the realities of the “European project”. Today, Graham remains a passionate, bilingual European (culturally-speaking) and a strident supporter of the new outward-looking opportunities which Brexit presents.

Since the late 1990's Graham has been self-employed; working as business consultant for some of the UK’s principal telecommunications and managed services companies. He also setup a small manufacturing business, building wine cellars over a 15-year period, whilst employing a small team of ex-offenders in his workshop in Farnham.

From working-class roots, he holds political views which are right-of-centre, moderate and coherent. A believer in small state, low taxation economies which operate 'within their means', Graham maintains that SMEs are the beating-heart of Britain’s economy, providing 16m jobs and accounting for half of its income. This has been wilfully ignored by successive governments, creating a hostile economic environment for entrepreneurs in recent years.

Graham’s optimistic and considered political views advocate a move away from mangled Keynesian group-think ideas around money printing, high taxation and expanded public spending to stimulate growth. On climate change, he supports a rational decarbonisation policy, which takes full account the UK’s carbon abatement costs, without leaning on the dishonest policies of offshoring of our heavy industry & carbon footprint.

He believes that young people deserve better opportunities through structured apprenticeships and a shake-up of our poor-quality, overly expensive university system, which prioritises high-paying, foreign students over British students. Rewarding young voters who are willing to invest in themselves should be a key priority of this next government.

Graham’s decision to stand for election with Reform-UK stems from a profound belief that a new approach is required. His aim is to re-engage the people of Godalming & Ash into the political process and encourage Surrey voters to reject the declinist narrative by voting for a party which advocates positive change.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/116317/cfa17e68-5a34-414a-b08d-2101febec8db.png

Their youngest daughter is in her final A level year at Wyke College with her sights on “what next”, their eldest in her final year at Newcastle University studying Human Geography. They have a very energetic dog and an extremely laid-back cat.   Angela has represented the Green Party since 2019 to contest the seat for the Haltemprice & Howden   constituency – the small but mighty Green Army team returned a respectable 3.5% of the vote share. In May 2019, Angela had given the Conservatives a very close fought run for their money coming within only 44 votes for the local Election.

She was delighted to support local Independent candidate David Howard to ultimately defeat the Conservative stronghold in Howden in 2023. During Lockdown, Angela supported Howden Helpers with the weekly co-ordination of delivering groceries to the isolated and vulnerable in the Town and surrounding villages.   Angela has many local connections having worked, volunteered and been an ardent supporter of local causes in and around the Constituency since moving to the area over 20 years ago. As a working Mum, her current role is Director of Pocklington Arts Centre (not for profit). She proudly works alongside the Team (largely volunteer led) to deliver community engagement and access to the Arts in this vibrant creative hub of the Region. She has also worked for Castaway in Goole and again as an advocate for the Arts - currently sits as Chair of the Advisory Board for Goole Junction and as a member of the Board for East Riding Libraries.   Angela is originally from East Kilbride in Scotland but Yorkshire is home. She has lived in the same family home near Howden since 2002 and has established strong roots and connections to the area through various voluntary roles and as General Manager of beloved local Venue Howden Shire Hall from 2014-2021. 

She has had many links to local education over the years - as Chair of Howden pre School, delivering Sport and Drama sessions in Schools and to Brownies and Scouts and as a Governor for a small, rural primary School. She is known to many as a Yoga Teacher - and continues to make time to share her practice once a week online which she says helps to keep her grounded, connected and offers a welcome decompression from balancing a full-time job and the pressures of funding cuts and limited resources in the Arts.

On 4th July 2024, she will represent the Green Party in the newly drawn Boundary for Goole and Pocklington against the incumbent Conservative MP David Davis. Interestingly, it is likely that David Davis and Angela Stone will be the only two common names to appear on ballot papers in 2019 and 2024 - they both live in the Constituency but only one of them is a visible and active part of the community.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/68449/ed507e3f-7f0c-46d3-adf7-bc058f4d5537.png

I was the first in my family to go to University - no easy feat, as the immigrant son of an immigrant.

I have worked in the Oil & Gas Business for almost 30 years, and myself and my wife have raised our family right here in Aberdeen.

Previously, I have been a Labour Councillor for the London Borough of Newham from 1998 until 2002. During this time, I achieved the position of Deputy Chair for Regeneration. 

Within the Education Committee, I was a lead member with special responsibilities too. Within the Labour Group, I was the assistant secretary and a deputy whip. As a management committee member of the Newham Citizen’s Advice Bureau (CAB), I served during a time when several CABs were being merged and had to deal with a number of difficult financial and personnel issues, including reduced budgets and re-advertising of positions.

I was a member of the ‘Forest Gate Single Regeneration Board (FG SRB)’. The FG SRB had £52 million to Forest Gate.

The biggest challenged faced by the world today is still poverty. It cannot be eradicated by providing people with just buildings and structures - but needs to be addressed through education, and better distribution of opportunity and wealth.

Closer to home, within Aberdeen, I was a member of a Community Council for several years, where I took an active interest in Core Paths and Environmental issues.

Aberdeen and what it needs

The word on everyone’s lips at the minute is, sadly, Brexit.

Aberdeen is set to be the hardest hit city anywhere in the UK in any Brexit Scenario. I don’t believe that Brexit will benefit the citizens of this city. Thus, I would campaign to Remain in the European Union in the event of a confirmatory referendum. 

Additionally, I would oppose any Brexit deal which allowed the Scottish Nationalists to impose another independence referendum before the next Holyrood elections. 

Aberdeen needs a strong and clear vision to continue the regeneration infrastructure projects that it has.  The educational standards are good in some area and need help in others.  

Health, like across our country, is delivered by excellent professionals - but we need more investment to ensure better services. 

That’s why I back plans for £70billion worth of investment in Scotland under the next Labour Government, providing a funding boost for Scotland’s NHS, schools and other vital services. 

Looking at our age demographics, improved Social Care needs to be developed.  Though this is a relatively well-off town there are poor areas that need support.     I will work tirelessly for better funding of public services, including increasing education standards, access to medical services and much better social care (for our older community who have worked hard all their lives only to find out they have to sell everything). 

Additionally, I support Labour plans to save free tv-licences for over 240,000 over-75’s in Scotland under the next Labour Government.  

Like many workers in the oil and gas sector, I was made redundant and I know all too well the mental stress this can put people under.  

As your Labour candidate for Aberdeen North, I believe we need to protect people from bad employers by working with our Trade Union colleagues and develop better re-training schemes.  

I don't want oil workers to have the same fate as coal miners did with their skills being wasted, many left unemployed and whole communities devastated. 

The jobs in 20 years time will be very different from those we have today.  Aberdeen with its unique skills base in Energy can continue to be a hub for Labour’s Green Industrial Revolution and the 'Energy Worker of the Future'.

I support Labour plans to introduce new green jobs in Scotland, and look forward to championing Aberdeen as the new international hub for renewable energy, engineering, production and investment. 

I have experience as a campaigner, an activist, a concerned citizen and an elected representative, I have experience in the energy industry which is central to the present and the future of this region, and above all I have experience of representing constituents in delivering real change for inner-city communities.

I hope you can lend me your vote on December 12th. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at NurulForNorth@outlook.com. 

Fraternally,

Aged 18, he spent his “gap-year” in Afghanistan with the Resistance against the Russians. During university holidays he returned to Afghanistan and Pakistan, worked as a teacher in Soweto, South Africa, and visited Nicaragua.

At the end of his University career, Adam was accepted into the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, and was subsequently commissioned into the Grenadier Guards. He served as an armoured infantry platoon commander in Cold War Germany and as a Captain in Iraq during the First Gulf War. He was also an instructor for trainee guardsmen.

After serving for four years, he went on to become a television reporter. His well-known documentaries included the “No Fixed Abode” series on World in Action, where he lived homeless on the streets of London for three months. This program gained record prime time audiences. ITV then gave Adam his own series of undercover documentaries that saw him in a wide range of situations; joining the victims of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, living as a homeless psychiatric patient and as a disabled person in a wheelchair. Later he worked at ITN; first as a general reporter, then as a correspondent in Sarajevo during the siege. Finally he ran the investigative unit on News at Ten, which included him posing as a paedophile sex tourist in the Philippines to uncover child prostitution.

In 2003, Adam returned to Iraq as a war journalist (with Marie Colvin, the remarkable Sunday Times journalist who was sadly killed in Syria in 2012), and posed as an economic migrant at the Sangatte refugee camp in Calais.

Adam was elected to serve as the MP for Gravesham in May 2005 with a majority of 654 and re-elected in 2010 with a majority of 9,312. In 2006, he was appointed to the Defence Select Committee, which he left in September 2010 to join the Government as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister for Europe. Adam resigned from that post in October 2011 when he was asked to vote against a non-binding Backbench Motion offering the British people a Referendum on Europe. Adam again served on the Defence Select Committee from November 2012 to November 2014. He is currently a member of the Public Administration Select Committee. During his time in Parliament he has taken a close interest in the war in Afghanistan and has visited outside the military envelope, at his own expense and that of a number of kind donors, about a dozen times. He was also in Benghazi during the fighting, and in Tripoli in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the city. Most recently he has been to the frontline of the Islamic State in northern Iraq.

Adam has been described as ""continuing to buck trends as a constituency MP”. He was co-Chairman of the Council for Arab British Understanding, and is Vice- Chairman of the Conservative Middle East Council.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/5516d1cd929f1bbe286be040.png

Lauren has a background that is grounded in public service growing up in a household with a nurse mother and a businessman father understanding the value of both public and community service as well as the private sector both being indispensable for our economy and community wellbeing. She has brought that forward in her own life by serving as a teacher and also as a Councillor for over eight years.



Outside politics Lauren is married and is a proud mum to two children educated at local state schools and as well as being a qualified teacher herself giving her a valuable insight into the education system. Lauren is a research scientist who has for many years working on neglected tropical diseases such as malaria. Lauren enjoys the great outdoors often found exploring forests and hills on holidays along with her camera to photograph scenery and then paint them.



Lauren's values are what are needed for every elected representative, and she feels are missing from national politics at the moment. Values such as social justice, wanting everyone to have the chance to succeed in life no matter their background, ability or need, feeling that our children should have the best start in life with an education system that is fit for purpose. Values of integrity and compassion which should be at the heart of politics ensuring that decisions are taken with the needs of the public at the centre.



Most of all Lauren feels that Gravesham has so much potential that is being held back by the Conservatives and can only be unlocked by a Labour MP and a Labour Government. Gravesham has a proud history and heritage spanning centuries that needs investment, our health service that has suffered from years of Tory neglect, with families and adults struggling with housing needs where there are too few truly affordable rents or buy options.



Lauren as a Labour MP for Gravesham with a Labour Government will be a strong voice in Westminster to call for the investment Gravesham needs to unlock its potential. That is why Lauren's campaign will focus on 'Unlocking Gravesham's Potential'

I work within the NHS and am also a Reform UK Ward Councillor on North east Lincolnshire Council. 

At a local level I work hard representing residents and helping wherever possible with their local issues. North east Lincolnshire Council had previously been a Labour stronghold, but since 2019 has been run by the Conservatives. Both Parties have failed to advance the area and the Council continues to come under intense scrutiny locally due to some of the decisions made and obsession with vanity projects.

I have been politically active since the age of fifteen, being elected as the youngest Councillor in the country aged eighteen. I recently resigned the Conservative Party whip and joined the Reform Party, because I truly believe Reform’s policies will take our country forwards.

Like many people, I became disillusioned with the last decade of Government, I have also witnessed Labours shift to the extreme left under Jeremy Corbyn, supported in full by Kier Starmer. I cannot support a man who cannot definitively state what a woman is. 

I realised that I had become politically homeless, with neither of the main political parties offering common sense policies, credibility or demonstrating any care for communities or our Country.

I cannot understand how the minority have been allowed to force this woke culture upon us, taking over our institutions and eroding our freedoms. Freedom of speech is, in my view an essential element of our democracy, but we are constantly questioned over the use of 'inappropriate pronouns'. I worry where this may end up. The Conservatives have allowed it during their time in Government, and I fear a Labour Party would only make it worse. What is a woman, Keir? 

Our border control is failing. Both legal and illegal migration is wholly mismanaged and has resulted in over ten million immigrants welcomed in the last twenty years. This is with minimal improvements to roads, rail, schooling, NHS or defence. Our Justice system is close to collapse, prisons overflowing, net zero being forced upon us whilst developing countries pump out CO2 in huge quantities. 

I approached Reform UK after studying their policies and watching their rapid growth over the last few years. The party shares pretty much every view that I hold. 

People do say to me that a vote for Reform UK is a vote for Labour. In my opinion, the Conservatives are already set for many years in opposition regardless. And deservedly so for what they have done to our people and country. But in Grimsby and Cleethorpes, as UKIP have shown before with impressive polling, we could just steal this election from under Labour’s nose. Whether Labour or the Conservatives were to get in, you would be getting two sides of the same coin, so a vote for Reform is not a wasted vote.  

Many people also ask me what I could hope to achieve if elected with Reform UK in Grimsby and Cleethorpes. Simply, I can be the most straight-talking voice that our area has ever had in Westminster. Unwhipped, holding any Government to account relating to local and national issues, I enjoy questioning decisions and making alternative solutions. I am a young man who is hungry for change.

In that short period of time, I have helped over 5,000 residents with advice and support.

I have helped protect and promote local charities, voluntary groups and services which residents depend on and that change lives.

I have fought to defend our local health services. I’ve campaigned for better public transport links across the constituency. I’ve fought tooth and nail for improvements to Southeastern train services and for TfL to take over the franchise in 2018. I've opposed education funding cuts that will have a devastating impact on our local schools.

At a time of unprecedented change to our local area, I’ve fought for sustainable development that benefits local communities, not just overseas investors. I've worked alongside community groups to press for a clean, green Enderby Wharf cruise liner terminal, to oppose plans for a Silvertown Tunnel and to secure an IKEA that actively promotes public transport use.

In Parliament, I’ve fought against the closure of Woolwich barracks. I forced the Government to change the law to levy bigger fines on rogue landlords. I’ve championed the environment and ambitious measures to clean up our toxic air. I have been a strong advocate for renewable energy and a more rapid transition to a green economy.

At stake in this election is the type of country we want to be. The majority of local residents, including me, did not vote to leave the EU — but the British public did and I accept the close but clear referendum result. However, I reject the extreme and damaging hard Brexit that the Tories are pursuing and I will vote against any deal that does not deliver for the people of this country.

More than ever, residents need a local representative in Parliament to defend and champion their interests. I know the challenges our communities face and am already engaged in addressing them.

I was born and grew up in Guildford, and have lived locally almost my entire life, from Boxgrove to Mareschal Road and now Drummond Road.

I have been a Green Party member since my first general election vote in 2010. I voted tactically for the Liberal Democrats only to see the coalition government u-turn on countless promises (especially to students and young people), and help bring in successive Conservative governments who have been a disaster for the UK over the past 14 years.

This time round, voters don’t need to vote tactically *against* the worst option – with the Conservatives set to lose in a landslide, we can finally vote *for* the policies, people and parties we believe in.

As the other parties slide ever closer to the Conservatives, the Green Party has remained a strong voice for the bold, transformative policies we desperately need. We have always been consistent whether on public services or tackling inequality, cutting bills or working for peace in Ukraine, Gaza and worldwide.

I’m thrilled to see soaring Green support around the whole constituency – from lifelong voters for other parties, and across all walks of life. Every bit of support and every vote is hugely appreciated.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions. I hope to see you on your doorstep, at a local event or out and about in the coming weeks!

From May 2010 to May 2024 I served as the MP for the previous Halesowen & Rowley Regis constituency, and during that time I worked to support local people, businesses, charities, friends' groups, churches and other voluntary organisations to ensure that our area is a better place to live, work, do business and raise a family. That is what I’ll continue to do if I’m elected again as a Member of Parliament. 

Before becoming an MP I ran a small business specialising in computer software, and also founded an independent campaign called ‘Mind the Gap’ to encourage civic action and more local grass roots involvement in politics. I also worked as Chief Executive of Localis, a local government think tank, where we worked to produce ideas to give local people more of a say over how decisions made by local and national governments affect them. I regularly use the experiences I gained before 2010 to help me understand the challenges of local people and businesses and think about how I can best support them.  

During my time as an MP I regularly hosted Jobs & Skills Fairs in Halesowen & Rowley Regis, bringing together local employers and training providers to boost employment prospects for local people. I also championed better support for mental health and have hosted roundtable meetings with providers to see how the support provided can be extended and improved. I joined in with many community projects including litter picks and clean up events, and I ran surgeries in the constituency, to talk to local people about the challenges they are facing and seeing where I can help.  

I have also previously sat on the Communities & Local Government Select Committee, chaired the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Mental Health, and represented the Lords & Commons Cricket Team against other Parliaments. I held several roles as a Parliamentary aide to ministers and spent 18 months as a Vice-Chairman of the Conservative Party. As part of my interest in mental health, I have argued for increased funding and a greater ‘parity’ between mental and physical health care, as well as arguing for reform of the Mental Health Act. 

In 2019 I was invited to serve as a Government Whip, helping to ensure our legislative programme is delivered. Between 2021 and 2022 I was additionally the ‘Vice-Chamberlain of HM Household’, a senior position within the Whips Office which involved keeping Her Late Majesty The Queen updated on House of Commons proceedings. As part of the ceremonial duties with the role, I was ‘held hostage’ at Buckingham Palace during the 2022 State Opening of Parliament, a custom that dates back to the Civil War to ensure the safe return of the sovereign. I also had the privilege of attending a Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral for the Queen during her Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June 2022.  

Between July and September 2022 I served as a Minister at the Department of Health & Social Care, with the title of ‘Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Primary Care and Patient Safety’. The role was a regular reminder of the great NHS that we are fortunate to have, and during my time as an MP I met many dedicated doctors, nurses and healthcare staff who have an inspiring commitment to public service. 

From October 2022 to May 2024 I served on the Health & Social Care Select Committee, where our role was to provide an objective scrutiny of the work of the Department of Health & Social Care and keep Ministers and officials accountable. I also chaired two APPG’s  - one for Shakespeare and one for Cyber Security, two areas where I have keen interests. However, my most important role in Parliament was to bang the drum for Halesowen & Rowley Regis, and help secure jobs, investment and better standards for schools and hospitals. 

Away from politics, I am married to Anna and we have two children, Sol and Evie. I have a keen interest in cricket and enjoy the theatre, reading and running. I ran the London Marathon in 2018 and 2019 to raise money for Halas Homes and Ups and Downs respectively, two local charities.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/551b3b3413eb34c82843cb62.png

Find out more about Samuel in this Q&A article What is your background?

Born in the Royal Calderdale Hospital, I have lived and worked in Calderdale all my life. I recently graduated from the University of Leeds with a master's degree in History. Tell us about your career.

For the last ten years, I have worked in a local textile factory which specialises in piled fabric. It is one of only two factories in the UK which specialise in this material, both for which are right here in Calderdale. Being one of the third generation of my family to work in this line of business, I first entered it to cover the cost of my university tuition. Although employed primarily in data entry, I often carry out a wide range of tasks within the Knitting Department, chiefly tending to knitting machines. However, I do ultimately wish to pursue a career where I can put my history degrees to good use. What are your hobbies?

My hobbies include walks in the local countryside, going to the gym, reading alternate history, science-fiction, political thriller, and modern classic books, watching films, and cooking.

  Why are you running for election?

There are many problems facing our community, and the country at large. A housing shortage, a climate crisis, underfunded and understaffed public services, and – particularly here in the 'Happy Valley' – a drug problem. These issues affect everyone but will impact younger generations the hardest. I wish to bring about positive change for Halifax and the United Kingdom, and to represent those desperately in need of a voice. Why vote for Liberal Democrats rather than Labour or Conservative?

The Conservatives' track record for the past fourteen years is marked by deceit, disaster, and decline. Labour promise that 'things can only get better' but are either parroting Conservatives talking points or backtracking on concrete policies that would deliver change. But only the Liberal Democrats have the policies and the commitment to change society, the country, and the world for the better. How can people make a difference and get involved locally?

Anyone can get involved locally in different ways. You can support our campaign by canvassing with us, helping us to deliver leaflets during Action Days, contributing a donation, and casting your vote for us come Election Day. No contribution is too small, and we appreciate any support you can give. Thank you. How can people contact you?

It’s time for change.

I have four priorities:

Policing not politics

In 2024/25, Hampshire’s ‘Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner’ will cost taxpayers £3 million. The Liberal Democrats believe in abolishing Police and Crime Commissioners. I will return policing to the professionals and switch money back to the front line.

Work with communities

Since 2019, the number of Police Community Support Officers has fallen by 23% in Hampshire. I want to restore community policing and have stronger action on anti-social behaviour, with officers having time to focus on preventing and solving crime.

I also want to end disproportionate stop and search. In Hampshire & the Isle of Wight, people from black communities are much more likely to be stopped and searched. This damages trust in police and isn’t delivering the results that any community wants. I want the police to work better with all Hampshire’s communities and rebuild the trust so essential for cutting crime.

Fairer police funding

With most police funding decided nationally, Hampshire does badly – around £41.6 million worse off than it needs. We have fewer police officers than in 2010. I will stand up for Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, fight for fairer funding and work to reverse the fall in police numbers.

Listening to you

I want to hear what you think about policing in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Let me know your views today via https://crimesurvey.pradbains.uk.

I was born in Hammersmith, grew up in Kingston as a member of the Sri Lankan Tamil community there, and have lived in Hammersmith since 2006. My career has spanned education and the arts, which (at their best) are about encouraging questioning, critical thinking and creativity. Whether in my former job as a primary school teacher or my current role in a young people’s charity, I have always focused energetically on encouraging people to engage critically with ideas and challenges, not finding fault for the sake of it, but to identify answers to problems and to imagine a hopeful future where real, big, exciting changes become possible in people’s lives. I don’t say this is an easy thing to do. I know from experience it’s hard to find the space and the energy to work in the world when it is as troubled as it seems right now. To then find the head space to imagine how it could be better in the future can feel impossible and overwhelming.

However, coming from two sectors that are hugely underfunded, often undervalued and where time is always tight, where the pressure to deliver against targets is high, I know that change is incremental and achievable and happens every day. And I know that it takes an imaginative approach to make that change happen even though it can feel like you’re swimming against the tide.

These challenges are part of politics too. For too long, the old parties have been allowed to treat the problems we face as inevitable facts of life, or a can to be incessantly kicked down the road. But, as Caroline Lucas, MP, our current City Hall Greens (Sian Berry, Zack Polanski and Caroline Russell) and hundreds of elected Green councillors across the country have shown, there are realistic alternatives that with imagination, persistence and hard work can be communicated and translated into policies that inspire people and change their lives. I am really excited to campaign for policies that offer real solutions to the crises that people face in this country. Policies such as a wealth tax, ambitious plans for housing and insulation and a programme of green jobs. There is plenty to be done. But we can do it.

A key thing I’ve learnt through my work, whether as an employee or volunteer is how change can only happen when people are truly heard and empowered to participate in finding the solutions. We need everyone’s unique contribution in order to succeed, which is why diversity and genuine respect are so important. I’m excited to be standing with Greens across the country, committed to campaigning on an inclusive platform. We need to get better at representing the diversity of our home and I’d be proud to be a Sri Lankan Green MP candidate.

My priority as an MP would be to identify the best ways to become a genuinely child-friendly country. As a teacher, I know that by meeting the needs of the most vulnerable we improve everyone’s lives. Children and young people have had an incredibly rough ride in the last decade. I’ve seen first hand the many issues children and the adults that work with them have faced. And almost all of them are rooted in inequality. Without more equal access to green spaces, creative education and cultural opportunities, clean, breathable air, safe and affordable housing, and a transport system that is cheaper and truly accessible for everyone we will not build the future our children deserve.

I’m committed to working for a Greener, more equal constituency here and would ask you to support me as the Green candidate for Hammersmith and Chiswick.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/83921/d6f3fbb9-30dd-4c71-a4a4-a55d01c5b313.png

I fight for working people everyday at UNISON, and I will continue to fight for a fairer society with the same passion in Parliament.

Professionally I am a Scrum master (Agile software team servant leader) and I am a proud father and husband.

I have always been keenly interested in the environment and the issues regarding the sustainability of our world. I co-founded Transition-Town-Market-Harborough in 2007 and through this group have been actively promoting the goal of sustainability. I initiated the bid process to the ""Big Lottery"" that led to the award of £1 million to run a sustainability project known as “Sustainable-Harborough”. I am also a voluntary director of the not-for-profit company “Harborough Energy”.

I became politically active prior to the 2015 General Election feeling that none of the traditional parties represented my views and having watched in dismay as the polemic policies of various governments dragged the poor NHS and education systems this way and that to satisfy political ideologies. With the growth of the Green party and its intention to give people the chance to vote for a sustainable future I felt I had no choice but to get involved.

It will be my mission to give the community more control over future housing developments. Drive through the requirements for better quality building, give the residents of the Harborough constituency a voice in the local political process, protect local health provision and fight for quality local jobs.

Globally we are in the clutches of a Climate emergency but the 2050 net zero target of our government is too little too late, the Green parties Green New Deal will drive down our emissions and create a new democratic Green industrial revolution providing quality, well paid jobs.

I hope that you share this vision of a better, healthier, more equitable future and vote for the Green Party on May 4th.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/23461.png

I was invited to be a member of a public advisory panel for a research project that is looking into the conditions of the residents of converted commercial buildings and we have one more year to run before the results are published.

I have a strong sense of what is right and decided to run as a Councillor after witnessing how planners and developers are kept updated more than the residents of Harlow and the lack of social housing that is desperately required.

I will be a strong voice and MP for you, championing your causes and ensuring things get done here.

Securing jobs and investment for our town is personal to me and for too long we have been let down by politicians who over-promise and under-deliver. The Conservative rhetoric of 'levelling up' has never met the reality of our ambitions for Hartlepool. This has to change.

There is an alternative, one that can rebuild Britain, one that recognises that our country's wealth and prosperity has always been built on the innovation of working people and the industry that is proudly part of Hartlepool's heritage.

A Labour Government will reinvigorate Britain: new industry, an economy focused on growth and properly funded public services. As your MP, it will be my mission to ensure that Hartlepool is at the heart of that future.

Working with local people, organisations, communities and businesses we can make a real difference in OUR town.

My pledges:

TO BE A LOCAL VOICE

I grew up in our town and I'm raising my family here. Hartlepool's future is my children's future and will fight every day for our town, our people and our future.

TO TAKE BACK OUR COMMUNITIES

We need to make our town safe again by taking back our communities from the antisocial and criminal minority who think the rules do not apply to them.

TO STAND UP FOR OUR TOWN

Hartlepool needs new investment in jobs, business and our public services. will stand up for our town by being Hartlepool's voice in Parliament, not Parliament's voice in Hartlepool.

TO FIGHT FOR FAIRNESS

Too many of our children live in poverty, too many of our older people lack the care they need, too many of our families are struggling. I will fight for a fairer deal for our people.

TO ENSURE A NEW START

Supporting local businesses to thrive, attracting new industry to invest, increasing support to our public services to deliver. This is what I will do to give Hartlepool a fresh start

""Medway is a very divided area, but there is one thing which unites us all; and that’s the environments we share and air we breathe"". Recent political catastrophes have proven just how much our systems are in desperate need of change, which is why a vote for Jeremy will help ensure the status-quo is changed.

“We’ve long been fed narratives like “that’s how it is, things never change so get used to it,” when referring to the common hardships we face. However, now more than ever is your opportunity to contribute towards genuine change to disprove these myths.”

Jeremy will bring a much needed fresh perspective to the current ways Medway Council operates. Gillingham residents deserve Green councillors working together as a team to bring the change we all so desperately need.

Outside of politics, Jeremy has spent the last couple of years working in technology and innovation, working for a building society which champions sustainability and using technology for social causes.

“If there’s one thing you can count on, it's that I will give 110% to everything that comes my way and together we can make change possible.”

In moving to Hastings, I joined the local Greens and helped out on election campaigns; working behind the scenes on data and speaking to voters on the doorstep. 

In my home ward of Castle during lockdown I witnessed the kindness, resilience and creativity of my neighbours. People rallying to help one another. Cleaning up their neighbourhood. That’s what I want to stand up for and channel within our Council: that positive, creative, ‘can-do’ attitude. I’m a natural problem-solver and feel energised to take on this ward’s more pressing problems: how do we regenerate the town centre as a safe space for all to enjoy, that puts the needs of the local people and environment before big investors? How do we raise every child in this borough safely and firmly above the poverty line? How do we provide our young people with local, meaningful employment? And how do we help our homes and businesses make sustainable, green choices on energy, transport and consumables? 

I bring an eclectic range of work experience: through performing to event production, waitressing to accounts administration, marketing to teaching, I have gained a broad skill-set and understanding of different walks of life. Underpinning everything I do is my passion for the environment and social justice. I am a founding member of the Clean Water Action Group, who organised Hastings’ first People’s Assembly on the topic. I’m part of a local recycling collective, who help each other recycle trickier items by sharing info and offering collections. I delivered foodbank orders to vulnerable residents throughout lockdown. I support numerous other local causes and I live, work and socialise within this very ward. I would be honoured to represent the people here.

My first task will be to open a space in the community so that you can speak directly to me. I have lived and worked within the Havant and Waterlooville area my entire life, and I am well aware of the challenges that face our community. If elected, I will be an active presence in the community.



I currently work as a teacher in the constituency and I am well aware of the challenges facing our children in schools, particuarly those with special educational needs, and I would like to work to fix this. Our schools need better funding to ensure our children have a bright future, and all students, regardless of class, have access to all available opportunities. Only a Labour government can secure this, with fully funded plans to deliver high standards in early years, mental health support, 6,500 more teachers and a focus on IT and oracy skills to help students secure meaningful jobs.



I want our town centres, from Emsworth to Havant to Hayling Island, to be a place to be proud of. I will work to ensure urgent investment in our communities, which will secure high quality jobs for local people and support for local business, as well as seeing our towns return to thriving social hubs. I will also work to protect people from inhabitable homes and empower tenants to take action if their homes are sub standard; everyone in Havant deserves a stable and habitable home. It is also important that infrastructure matches the numbers of homes being built, and so I will work to lobby for the correct levels of investment in to our communities.



All residents deserve to feel safe in their homes. It is imperative that crime and anti-social behaviour is tackled and I will make sure that our neighbourhoods are safe again through increased patrols and that each and every community in Havant has a named officer to get in touch with, to ensure a swift response to crime.



The NHS is the cornerstone of our brilliant country, but it has been brought to its knees. With a Labour Government, there will be no more scramble at 8am for a doctors appointment in the morning, a reduction in children being admitted to hospital for tooth decay and urgent reforms to ensure that the 1.2 million people waiting for mental health care are seen and receive the care they deserve. I will work to make sure that the people of Havant will benefit from these policies and receive the health care they deserve, improving access to all elements along the way.



We live in an area of natural beauty, but our rivers and seasides are being polluted, and I will work to protect these areas. I will work to improve air and water quality through making sure it is a priority in parliament. I enjoy countryside walks along the Hayling Billy or along the seafront in Emsworth and understand how important it is to protect these areas for future generations.



I will be a strong, local voice, working for our community and I would love to hear from you, please get in contact.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/95024/7e3c4b5a-9d59-44c9-a0b1-824fb552d350.png

Commenting on his selection, Alex said, ""I am proud to be the Liberal Democrat candidate for Ruislip, Pinner and Northwood, standing up for this diverse and inclusive community, in an economically important part of the capital.""

Alex has lived in London for 14 years and is a barrister by profession, formerly practising as a solicitor in private practice and in industry.  Born in Belgium to British parents, he is happy to call himself both British and European. He and his Lebanese American wife have two children and live in Ickenham.

Alex was, for many years, a school governor and active in residents’ associations. He stood in the council elections in 2006, 2010 and 2014, as well as the general elections of 2010 and 2015. Outside of politics, Alex spends as much time as he can with his young family, keeping healthy by training in kickboxing and running.

Alex is driven by a belief that individuals should have equal opportunity to achieve their potential and that more must be done for London’s youth. In his view, a combination of Theresa May’s Hard Brexit and ideologically-driven austerity are damaging local services and destroying the NHS.  Locally, he has publicly criticised Heathrow expansion as damaging and unwelcome, and is concerned about the impact on the local community of the construction of HS2.

Commenting further on his selection, Alex said, “Brexit threatens the economic prospects of our children and the country as a whole and I’m shocked by the damage being done to our country by the Tories.

I spent the first ten years of my career as a civil servant, and more recently have worked across Greater Manchester on projects tackling poverty and the inequalities caused by the Tory government.



I'm the Shadow Cabinet member for Economy, Regeneration and Housing on Stockport Council, where I've been standing up for residents across the borough, pushing for more support for neighbourhood and district centres, and focusing on community safety - issues that really matter in Hazel Grove.



I know how much potential there is in Hazel Grove. I'm committed to working with local businesses, public services and community groups to make the most of this potential.

Sherief has lived and worked in Hemel Hempstead for over 25 years where both of his children were born in Hemel Hospital. As well as working self-employed as a media consultant, Sherief has volunteered with Radio Dacorum as a presenter, is on the committee of the Friends of Halsey Field Local Wildlife group, and is a co-opted committee member of the Boxmoor trust.

Sherief has been campaigning for the Green Party in Dacorum for several years and given a commitment to never stop fighting for a clean future for the generations to come.

He said, “Hemel Hempstead is in desperate need of reliable trains and buses – and the situation is getting worse. If our rapidly growing town is to be sustainable, we have to fix this long-term problem now! Just building houses won’t fix our problems.”

Sherief stated, “For Greens the real challenge is the Climate Emergency. We are missing the opportunity to make the changes that safeguard all of our futures.

We are witnessing a very worrying decline in our environment, oceans, and air quality. We desperately need a Green New Deal to address climate chaos, prioritise renewables and public transport and to deliver a better way of life.""

Every policy we make is tested to make sure it works for the common good and is sustainable.

Our planet needs people in power who recognise that we are living in a climate emergency and are dedicated to taking action.

No other party has accepted that action has to happen now, not put off until later. The way that we treat our situation now will impact in five years. What we see now is due to the inaction from 2019 – the first time I ran for parliament. Let’s stop the irresponsibility and make real change where it’s needed.”",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/26776/39eda5ff-424d-48ad-88fc-3c7a59e70eb3.png

My roots are in Hemel. My parents grew up here, on Chaulden Terrace and Pentland in Highfield, met and got married in Hemel. My Nan lives in Adeyfield and my aunt and uncle and cousins in Grovehill.

Hemel has always been a place of promise. Like many families escaping poor or bombed out housing, my grandparents on both sides moved out here after the second war. This new town was one of Labour's finest achievements -- providing our families with decent housing, jobs, schools and healthcare.

But this promise of a better future has been stifled by the Tories in the decades since. My family experienced that first hand. My mum, a lab technician in Kings Langley and then Buncefield, was made redundant in the wake of the 1992 recession, so I know what it's like to worry about the gas bill, the price of the weekly shop, and how to pay the mortgage. It fell to my mum to care for my nan when she first got dementia, and she had to fight the council every step of the way to get her into her care home in Adeyfield so she got the dignity she deserved.

Those experiences made me Labour. I've dedicated my life to fighting poverty and inequality at home and abroad. That journey started 20 years ago when I represented Hemel in the UK Youth Parliament, and along the way I've worked for international charities such as Oxfam, fighting for human rights from Syria to Yemen, and pushing for change at the UN and at global climate talks. Right now in my day job, I fight for trade justice, so workers and co-operatives in some of the poorest places in the world get a fair wage and fair price.

But charity only takes you so far. I know that it's politics and political choices that really make the biggest difference. I'm proud to have been an adviser to Gordon Brown and to serve our party as the founder of the Labour Campaign for International Development. I've been at the heart of efforts when our movement has saved and changed millions of lives - and helped pass a law that protected our international aid budget from Tory cuts. I've campaigned for Labour governments for nearly twenty years, knocking on doors in some of the toughest, most marginal seats around the country.

And I've been using those experiences to fight for change here in Hemel. At the council elections in May, I built and led a team that turned Adeyfield East from a safe Tory ward into a marginal, helping my running mate Barbara Pesch be elected and coming within 34 votes of ousting the Tories' own leader in Dacorum himself. I've also been meeting with community groups across Hemel to understand what more we can do to help people through the worst cost of living crisis in living memory.

As your candidate and MP, I will work with all of you for a Hemel that fulfils its founding promise and is the best possible place to live, work, bring up a family and grow old in.

There aren’t enough local police. Nothing seems to work anymore. We deserve so much better. It’s time for change.

I believe in our country. My father is a Holocaust survivor who came here as a child refugee. The NHS helped me overcome a speech impediment and it saved my daughter’s life when she was born extremely prematurely. These experiences have shaped my determination to build a better future for all.

If I’m elected as your MP, I’ll bring change.

I hold the strong belief that we are a sovereign and island nation, and that we should not be governed by any foreign court or organization. I recognize that the inevitable cycle of alternating Team Red and Team Blue at Westminster is a cycle doomed to failure. Both parties have proved unreliable, and both are distracted by interminable and counter-productive internal disagreements. Over the years, neither party has proved willing or capable of offering what we, the electorate, wants and voted for.

Owing to this regrettable state of affairs, today it is difficult to find anything in our country which is not broken or which is still fit for purpose. For example - Border Control, the Police, the N.H.S., the Economy, suitable support for Veterans, Cost of Living, Pensions, Employment, Education, etc. The current High Tax and Low Growth policy is unsustainable, and we are seeing our country and our way of life being ruined. We are a democracy, but we are not getting the government that we deserve. Reform UK is the alternative that can help us to achieve a better life.

Through Reform UK, I want to help turn our country around. To stop the rot. To bring back prosperity to our country. To mend broken Britain. I am standing as a candidate for Reform UK, because it is the only party that recognizes that we need to examine all our main institutions and work out how they can be restructured and revitalized to meet our needs and how these changes can realistically be financed – as detailed in our equivalent of a manifesto called ‘Our Contract with You’ on the party website. Click the link to view it at: https://www.reformparty.uk/policies

As your Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Hinckley and Bosworth Constituency, I consider myself very fortunate to have this opportunity to work towards these goals.  I believe we can save Britain and make our lives better. A vote for Reform UK is a vote for change - change for the better.

An M.P. has an important role in national government, but also has a duty to represent all constituents at a local level. I have lived in Barwell for the past 8 years, so I have genuine local knowledge of the main concerns and problems we face in the constituency where I am standing for election. I know, for example, that there are particular issues concerning the expansion of towns and villages without the infrastructure and facilities being upgraded, thus increasing the pressure on the existing infrastructure and facilities, the present planning system is broken, it ignores cumulative effect of developments and the true need for major road improvements, new schools and G.P. Surgeries, I shall do my best to fight for a common sense, fair and balanced revision of the Planning Laws.

I became active in mainstream politics when the Brexit Party was formed. I became a member, and later held the position of Bosworth Constituency Coordinator. When the Brexit Party became Reform UK, I transferred my membership. I have previously served for 10 years as an independent parish councilor, recently I have been a candidate for Reform UK in both the County Council and Borough Council Elections.

Now I am hoping that you will support me to act for you on a national level as your Constituency M.P., because, to quote our party, ‘Britain needs Reform and Reform needs You’. It can be done, and I really believe we can do it.

If you have any questions or comments or wish to offer support, I look forward to hearing from you.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/75366/f28e8013-f8f4-4f93-b3b3-c347cb86b7b2.png

I have always been an active member of Exeter’s community, having lived, worked and grown up in the City and its surrounding areas. Now, having made further roots in the City as a student, I am excited to give back to the City that has provided me so much throughout life.

As an active community-facing representative, I will ensure that you have a voice right to the very top of the Council’s Labour leadership. The Conservatives have consistently failed to provide a voice for the area, and I will make it my political mission to make sure St Loyes is not left out of the conversation.

I have a record of community delivery through my work. As a sitting East Devon District Councillor in a Conservative-dominated area, I have worked hard to represent all the residents of our neighbouring District through Council decisions and active casework resolution.

I understand the importance of providing strong local services in the face of massive cuts, and I will ensure our services are protected and invested in across all of St Loyes.

I am deeply driven by community work, founding and running a not-for-profit food redistribution organisation and working as a charity trustee for a Theatre Company. Through this community-driven action, I have worked closely with those in need across our region and understand the struggles that our Council tenants and social renters face.

I will champion all residents of St Loyes no matter your income, providing the support that residents need through the ongoing Conservative created Cost of Living Crisis.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/73109-b77143a3-cad8-485a-b016-16f5784586d9.png

I am not a career politician. I am a registered mental health nurse working for the NHS and you may have heard this before, but… I have a dream. I dream of a world where individuals feel empowered to succeed and where that hard work pays off. Where we have freedom of speech without offense or persecution. Now I believe that dream is achievable, but this is where I need your help.

Many of you may; or may not be familiar with me as a town councillor in Hetton Town Council. Where I help to support the local community in dealing with the issues raised. Or as my role earlier as a nurse within the NHS. However, I am also your candidate in the upcoming general election with Reform UK.

My journey did not start there. I ran for youth parliament at an early age and sat on many youth committees as I grew up in the small village within the town of Houghton-le-Spring. I was raised with values and under the dogma of Labour policies in which I felt was the backbone of the community; or as I soon came to realise was the cancer.

As my career began to develop, I became a manager of a community interest company that supported families and individuals of all ages with difficulties around neurodiversity. Particularly autism, as I have a strong connection, having been diagnosed with the condition myself.

I reached out to city councillors in various areas where I received some support from certain Labour Councillors, until it became apparent how my strong, hard efforts were benefiting them. After seeing these councillors use my voluntary work to apply for their own funding and meet with me to tell me how to cheat the system, I walked away from what I can only describe as corruption.

Keeping my morals and my dignity, I joined Reform UK. With Reform, I have found my home. I have joined a community in which I feel supported. I share my story so that you may find your home too. It may not be with Reform, but there will always be support here for you too.

Pink Floyd released the album “The Wall” in 1982 about being tormented at school by tyrannical, abusive teachers. The wall to me, is a depiction of the Labour “Red Wall” and as with all political walls, needs to fall. We need to celebrate diversity in choice, not only in the protected characteristics but within the belief of politics. I am not another brick in the wall, and neither are you.

My hope is to remind the world that justice, fairness, and freedom are more than just words—they are perspectives. These words that can offer the means to meaning and for those that will listen, the enunciation of truth. Bring back democracy; I do this for my family, I do this for my friends.

What kind of Leader is Chan Abraham? Here's what the public, tenants, staff say in their own words...

""Oxmoor…deprived, rife with crime, drugs and ill health exacerbated by sub-standard housing conditions has been transformed by the dedication, hard work, leadership, encouragement and caring attitude of one man who has encouraged and facilitated the various statutory agencies.  As far as the many residents of Oxmoor are concerned – Chan is already our local hero.""

​""Chan leads us in a culture based on trust, where all our staff are part of the family. We work in an environment where, passion, pride, courage and integrity are part of who we are and the way we do things. Chan models this behaviour, leading us in changing ourselves and in making the difference where we are. Chan cares about each and every one of his employees. He knows each one of us and will often walk through the office asking how our family members are (by name) and we know that we truly are members of the family.""

​""Chan’s focus covers all staff as everyone can meet with Chan if they need guidance or advice. Chan has taken a personal interest in my family and supported me when my wife developed breast cancer."" 

​""Over the years I have been with Luminus I have lost count of the times our people have said how moved they have been by Chan’s personal commitment to their well-being. This ranges from a personal birthday card from Chan to every staff member, a kind word or two about a family member at a chance meeting in a corridor and offers of financial assistance and personal mentoring when any one of our people are facing a personal or family problem.""

""As a tenant on the Board closely involved I can state that much of what has been achieved could not have taken place without the vision and drive that Chan has consistently provided.""

""I just want to say how grateful me and my daughter…are with the financial aid Chan gave her from the Joseph & Alice Foundation, (which he set up in memory of his parents) and funded personally to help people in need. Without his help she wouldn’t have been able to continue with her hairdressing course at Huntingdonshire Regional College.  She talks about the help Chan has given her all the time and has nothing but praise for him. He has given her the chance to make something of her life and we will be forever grateful.""

""Hello Chan you will be supported by me and friends. As not many of you will not know the kindness and understanding of Chan goes back a very long way. When my brother was killed in a car crash and Chan gave me all the time in the world to go home to Ireland and was very very understanding of my grief and my Families sorrow. Not only that he is a great kind compassionate Man. Thank you Chan. It would be truly lovely to have you in Parliament. God Bless""

Track Record of Standing For The People & Inspiring Transformation in Neighbourhoods, Communities and Business

""As your MP I will  stand fearlessly for you and those you love, holding Government to account for your wellbeing, security and flourishing. I will open up the corridors of power to The People so that The State never again can  dictate to you.""

Chan Abraham is well-known as a business and community leader serving this area since 1996 WITH A PUBLIC RECORD OF SAVING HUNTINGDONSHIRE FROM  LABOUR's DISASTROUS POLICIES AND CONSERVATIVES' MISMANAGEMENT when he introduced initiatives that transformed the quality of life, including giving local people a voice, better housing services and helping public organisations to work in partnership for the benefit of all, instead of wasting public resources.

In 1999 he personally led the area's largest public consultation through scores of open meetings with tenants of HDC's badly neglected 8,000 council homes, independently raising £100 million to buy and repair them.  Tenants voted overwhelmingly to become part of non-profit HHP-Luminus that he founded, enjoying a better future with low rents, improved repairs, new neighbourhood services and genuine People Power through seats on the Management Board. He gave HDC a windfall of more than £65 million strictly requiring better local services but this vast sum 'disappeared' into a financial black hole of the Conservative-LibDem-Labour-run council.

​As Director of Community Services he introduced improvements to Huntingdonshire’s leisure services, parks, culture and tourism, established Town Centre Management for Huntingdon (now BID Huntingdon), Community Safety Partnerships across Cambridgeshire so Police, NHS and other public services could work together; and helped release much-needed Hinchingbrooke Hospital beds saving the NHS substantial sums of public money by providing homes for older patients to receive nursing care in the community.

​Recognised as The Man of the People he held Saturday morning conferences and consultation events and kept an open door to all.  Government bureaucrats bristled with hubris and jealousy over his innovation, commitment to local people and independent thought, and tried undermine and sabotage his efforts, but he kept his Guarantee to tenants.  Luminus was recognised nationally as an example of excellent customer care and staff motivation, twice hitting the No. 2 spot on The Sunday Times 100 Best Companies to Work For, winning the Gold Medal for Health & Safety from The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents for 13 consecutive years and garnering more awards for excellence and inspiration than any other UK business.

Through his Leadership Academy he has trained, developed and mentored hundreds of managers and leaders in councils, Police, businesses and charities, helping many women and men progress to senior jobs. He helped build Huntingdon's Community Radio Studio in Huntingdon Town Centre, initiated extensive community projects including Oxmoor's Maple Centre and NHS Oak Tree Centre; new family, key worker, extra care and sheltered housing; established multi-agency health and children's safeguarding initiatives and apprenticeship schemes for young people; served communities on Mental Health Trust and Schools Governing Boards. and set up two new Charities with the theme of “Inspiring hope, changing lives, transforming our world”.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/115943/e5308117-fd9d-4b51-b739-fbdf4c918a73.png

Mark Argent is a committed European. He’s opposed to Brexit, and sure that the best deal possible is the one we already have as full members of the EU.

He’s been alarmed at the way Brexit has put the extremists in charge in both Conservative and Labour parties, leaving many people unable to vote as they usually would. The answer is to stop Brexit, and then address the division it’s caused, and the frustrations that led people to vote for it.

This means securing funding for the NHS, and finding the money by adding 1p to Income Tax. It means tackling wealth inequality, particularly around the cost of housing. It means moving decisions from Westminster much closer to the people affected by them — we deserve better than the shambles of a barely-accountable elected mayor for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.

Climate change is the biggest threat humanity faces, but it’s been pushed off the agenda by Brexit. We need urgent action to reduce CO2 emissions, which means alternative forms of energy, better insulation, electric vehicles,  improved public transport, and better rural broadband to make it easier for people to work remotely.

He’s concerned by Mayor’s proposals for another river crossing — through the heart of an area of exceptional beauty. Surely this has to wait until we know the effect of upgrading the A14, and even then, the priority should be improved public transport, which helps congestion and climate change. Relocating Marshall’s to Wyton is a good example of how business can be spread out from Cambridge, but there are real concerns about the effect on traffic.

Mark’s background is in publishing and web design. He ran a start-up soon after leaving university, and has experience of the high-tech sector as well as living and working in rural areas.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/6450.png

When the Liberal Democrats left Government in 2015, we left the UK with a strong and growing economy, standing proud on the international stage. Look how things have changed in two years - we have a Tory government in thrall to its own far-right MPs, set on scrapping human rights, forcing investment out of Britain and shrugging its shoulders at the growing NHS crisis. They have a slender majority so a competent, united opposition could hold them to account, but they’ve been allowed to run rampant under Jeremy Corbyn’s feeble leadership. In 2015, the people of Ilford North put their trust in the Labour party and look at what’s happened. Wes Streeting has voted against investigations into the illegal Iraq war and voted for the ‘Snoopers Charter’ that allows government mass-surveillance. Worst of all, he’s signed up to the Tories’ right-wing ‘hard Brexit’ agenda and voted with the Government to trigger article 50, even though the people of Redbridge voted to remain in the EU. Time after time, local people have been let down by Labour.

48% of the country voted to remain in the European Union and many of the 52% that voted to leave don’t want this right-wing hard Brexit where Britain gets dragged out of the single market, customs union and European Court of Human Rights. If enough of those people back me in Ilford North and other Liberal Democrats around the country, then we’ll win and we can show the world that Britain’s still open for business.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/48843.png

My grandad was the union treasurer at Scott's shipyard in the 1950s and 1960s.

My parents gave me the best start in life, taught me the value of hard work and the importance of service to others. When I was 17, I left Greenock for Ghana and spent half a year working with a charity there. It was an eye-opening experience that shaped my politics. I was lucky to have a great education and ended up at Oxford University.

After I graduated in 2007 I worked in the public sector and then for VSO UK, an international development charity. Since then, I've spent the last decade working on national campaigns and in 2017 I started my own business.

Since 2022, I've been the Labour Councillor for Gourock. Every day I see the great potential that exists in our communities, but also how too many people are being held back. I'm standing for election because I want to continue to give something back to the communities that made me who I am today and to elect a Labour Government that can change our country for the better.

I am urging you to VOTE CAMERON PALIN on May 6th!

I’ve lived in East Cowes for most of my life, where I have worked on many local issues, and volunteered in our community. I’ve helped lead numerous campaigns including: Demanding a new Floating bridge, a completion to Saunders Way link road, Save the Umbrella Tree and, fighting Against the Crossways Development. I am proud to be a loud voice standing up for the community on the council and in our media. 

Over the last 6 months I have been working hard on the East Cowes Town Council where I have already achieved many successes for our town. I’ve put forward many new ideas including an outdoor gym, a new recycling scheme, a water bottle refill site, and to keep challenging the Isle of Wight Council over the Floating bridge as well as much more. These successes have shown what is possible when we have a Green in the room, I pledge to continue to work hard in the community and to keep listening to what residents want!

When speaking to residents some of the major issues I hear that you want addressing include: The Floating bridge Fiasco, endless litter, large amounts of dog fouling, the over-development of housing and the shambolic Saunders way Link Road. The Conservative Councillor has had nearly 3 years to address these issues but he has not!

I am proud to stand to be your next councillor for Osborne as it is such a diverse ward with so much potential! I would work to get more support in place to make sure litter and dog fouling is tackled effectively using Environment Officers and making sure the law is enforced by giving out fines. I’d ensure Island roads, the Isle of Wight Council and Barratt Homes get together to complete Saunders way link road as this road has been incomplete for far too long! 

Whilst I have a vision of what our area could be like, it is so important to me your voices are heard, listened to and acted upon! This is why if I am elected I will have regular monthly meeting where you can meet me to tell me what you want doing. These drop-in sessions would help me tackle the vast amount of issues that need sorting and I will make sure what you care about is on the political agenda. 

I want to continue the positive work I have already begun, this is why I am hoping for your support in May. Elect me to represent you on both the Town and County Council. I will be your voice on the Council and I will make sure your priorities are heard at every level!

So please, on Thursday 6th May VOTE CAMERON PALIN.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/73043-07b54bd3-a72b-437f-bf91-d49da873b68e.png

She has campaigned tirelessly on national issues of importance to the Islington community, including the housing and climate crises.

As Shadow Attorney General she is working to reform the law on stalking, cohabitation and whistleblowing, to tackle fraud, and to fix charging rates to get justice for victims of crime.

She joined the Labour Party at 17, motivated by her experience being raised on a council estate on benefits by her single parent mother. Before her election she worked as a barrister for twenty years, representing amongst others striking miners, Wapping print-workers and P&O seafarers.

So I am extremely proud to be in a position now, as the MP for the Jarrow constituency, to be able to hold the government to account and demand ministers provide more support to working people.

I'm doing all I can to help people in the Jarrow constituency deal with the impact the Tory government is having on their daily lives. In parliament I've been asking questions and challenging ministers on their policies, from the NHS, cost-of-living crisis and the Post Office Horizon scandal, to housing, trade union rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and much more. I sit on the Women and Equalities Committee and have been pushing this government to deliver for women and minority groups to start tackling violence against women, the gender health gap, menopause at work, gender pay gap and many other campaigns supporting the other equality strands.

""Warwickshire deserves a genuine representative of the community who actually lives here. Time and again the voices of local voters have been ignored when it comes to setting government policy. We've seen that Green Party MPs in parliaments have a hugely outsized sway on the direction of legislation and public debate, and, if elected, I will uphold that.

We're ready for the 2024 General Election. Voting for the Green Party is a choice for affordable, common sense solutions to the major issues facing this country. No other party offers the hope and practical policies that the Green Party stand for.

When campaigning across the Kenilworth & Southam consituency, I've heard at the doorstep the issues most acutely felt by voters. The cost-of-living crisis has been devastating to the personal finances of many, exacerbated by the neglect of public services, roads, the NHS and social care.

Our communities have shown their resilience, through years of government-imposed austerity, the decline of high streets and environmental degradation. But, that is a testament to the resourcefulness and spirit of the wonderful people I've met. Business owners, community volunteers and local champions have been my inspiration.

I will put public wellbeing and the environment at the heart of my campaign. It's not a budget choice, because these are interconnected challenges, and they need interconnected solutions. You can't solve one without the other.

We deserve quality housing, in communities with thriving high streets, supported by well-planned active transport improvements. The government has failed to invest sufficiently, with its broken promises about levelling up.

Similarly, we need to clean up our rivers and properly support farmers to boost biodiversity and protect nature, in the many ways I've seen starting to happen across Warwickshire.""

She is deeply proud of the cultural heritage of the region; its strong associations with the Industrial revolution, its canals and railways, its continuous strengths in the automotive sector, its notable universities, its position in the heart of England and its vibrant and diverse communities. 

Jenny stood as the Liberal Democrat candidate for Sutton Coldfield in the 2017 and 2019 General Elections, as well as being a candidate for the European Parliament in 2019.  Outside of politics, she is actively involved in her local community.  She led a campaign to save her local library and has since set up a successful charity (FOLIO Sutton Coldfield) which offers an inspirational and engaging programme of educational events in or connected with the library.  She is also Governor at a local infant school, on the committee of the support group for Sutton Park and was involved in the local community response to Coronavirus.

Jenny says, “Right now, we are living through extraordinary times; yet there are examples all over our region of neighbours and communities supporting each other.  I want to harness that community spirit in my vision for a brighter future for our region - one where everyone has the opportunity to make the most of their lives and where we work together to make the West Midlands a better place for all.  I am passionate about supporting the growth of our region and building a thriving economy and vibrant community.

 As candidate for Mayor, I want to listen to people - understand their circumstances, their needs and their hopes – and be their voice to create a greener, fairer and kinder West Midlands we can all be proud of.

Professionally, I am Chartered Accountant and business consultant, having worked with a wide range of private and public sector entities over my 25-year career.  A significant part of my work has been focused on tackling fraud and corruption, with honesty, integrity and fairness being core values for me.

The immediate priority for our region must be to safely navigate the current crisis, ensuring that people and businesses get the support they urgently need.  Far too many people see their livelihoods at risk and remain unsupported by the governments measures, particularly the self-employed and those in the live events sector, as well as hospitality.  As we look to the future, I am optimistic that our region can play a pivotal role in growing a green economy and I look forward to builder a fairer and kinder community across the West Midlands, where everyone is valued and given the opportunity to make the most of their lives.”",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/10038/c9010da5-38d8-4b5d-b044-97aee8c87847.png

Priorities

The cost of living crisis effects everyone in the constituency. We all need warm houses, affordable food, and to get around. A range of Green initiatives will address these including: higher quality new-build homes and cheaper upgrading of existing homes, ensuring fresh and nutritious food is available in all areas, and improving public transport with £1 bus fares and reducing congestion by encouraging active travel.

Flooding from the sea is a serious threat to the constituency. The recently raised sea-wall is only designed to be effective until 2040, and may be over-topped before then. Residents and businesses in the constituency need clarity on the future flood risks and to be involved in the planning of sea defences.

The UK and this constituency have a historical duty to lead by example. This means reducing our greenhouse gas emissions in line with the UK's 2050 net-zero legal obligation an Hull's 2030 commitment. We need to protect the biodiversity in our environment by controlling pesticide use and improving the water quality in the tributaries to the Humber. We need to show moral leadership by condemning genocide and not aiding aggressors.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/37970/b72d2d51-34c3-4e6e-b7d8-220458eb9d57.png

Born and bred in the Black Country, I come from a family of hard working, talented people who share the experiences of many in this constituency.



My great grandad grew up in a workhouse, worked as a craftsman and fought with the Staffordshire regiment. A free school meal pupil, I am a first generation graduate.



I am proud of these roots. They drive my belief in the potential of our communities and businesses to prosper and thrive. But after 14 years of Conservative government, our future hangs in the balance. The Tories have wrecked the economy and driven our public services to breaking point. They have destroyed trust in politics and let people down.



I see this everyday in the work I do, in the school my children attend, in the businesses I have supported, and in the hospitals and GP surgeries I visit. I am standing because I know that Britain deserves better.



I have dedicated my career to improving frontline services, delivering changes to policing, child protection and leading campaigns for improved health and mental health care for young people and those impacted by addiction. Now it's time to use that experience to help bring about Labour's pledges to the country in Parliament. As an MP, I will work tirelessly to deliver the changes we need, working hard every day to earn the trust of my constituents.

I was born here, on the University Campus. My family moved south when I was young, when Thatcher’s cuts forced them to chase jobs wherever they could. But I chose to return to Leeds as a student, and moved to Headingley. I studied Information Systems at the University of Leeds and was elected as the Full Time Finance Officer of Leeds University Union in my final year.

I joined the Labour Party in 1997, and have been an activist ever since. I joined the party because of its ideals of equality and social justice, and I remain committed to those ideals. I have been active at every level of the party and am currently a Councillor for Meanwood and Moortown areas of Leeds.

I am married to Susan. We met whilst we were both working at the University of Leeds. Susan worked in the Welfare Office of Leeds University Union and I worked as the Community Relations Officer of the University. We have two boys, Jakob and Zachary. Jakob attends a local community primary school and Zac is at a Leeds City Council Children’s Centre. Susan is Debt Manager at St Vincent Support Centre, supporting some of the most vulnerable people in Leeds. We live in Weetwood Ward off Monkbridge Road.

I have worked as a Community Development Worker in Hyde Park, Headingley and Weetwood, and other areas of the City. I was a member of a succesful team which put together the bid for Leeds’ largest Surestart Scheme - for Little London, Woodhouse and Meanwood. This was a crucial step in helping to establish the Surestart programme here in Leeds. I have also helped to establish and develop many new community organisations all over the City.

I now work with social enterprises, supporting groups and individuals to set up social enterprises and running the regional body Social Enterprise Yorkshire and the Humber representing social enterprises and co-operatives. I am very proud of the part I’ve been able to play in establishing more than 200 co-operatives and social enterprises across Yorkshire, and in helping them to grow and develop.

I was elected to Leeds City Council for Moortown and Meanwood in May 2012. In that role I have been active in many local campaigns and achieved improvements in the environment and services for local people bringing in traffic calming schemes and helping secure the first new park in North Leeds for over 50 years.

I am deeply committed to Leeds and its people, and to the Labour Party and its ideals. I am standing for election in Leeds North West because I believe those ideals have the answers to the problems people here face, and because I want to put my experience and commitment to work for local residents.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/4370.png

He takes duty of being your Member of Parliament very seriously. That's why he promised not to take any second jobs and to hold regular and accessible advice sessions for local residents right across East Leeds. He has kept those promises.

Richard has helped thousands of local people in East Leeds facing tough times through no fault of their own.

Every vote for Richard is a vote for a strong local voice - from East LEEDS, for East Leeds. It's a vote to ensure East Leeds is not forgotten.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/4369/05a010b0-7758-40a5-8851-992ccdd6f39d.png

I've spent my life campaigning for change.



Whilst working at Friends of the Earth, I co-led the campaign for what became the world leading Climate Change Act, a legally binding framework to reduce emissions across our economy. The campaign united people who had never worked together before and became the fourth most supported motion in parliamentary history. I went onto lead our international climate change engagement work at the Department of Energy and Climate Change, supporting Ed Miliband at the UNFCCC conference. I became executive director at WWF-UK where I pioneered work on low carbon transition plans for the biggest companies in the UK. 10 years ago I was awarded an OBE for services to tackling climate change in the UK and overseas. There is much more to do - to address the threat and garner the opportunity - and I want Leeds to be at the forefront of the Green Industrial Revolution.



I want to help



1. Get Britain building again, so we can have the clean energy supplies of the future, bringing our costs down and ensuring sources of UK energy.

2. Switch on Great British Energy, so the country - and our public services - are benefitting from our investment in a national energy supply.

3. Getting the NHS back on its feet - I have a strong interest in mental health; I want to focus on improving support for mental health of young people within our constituency.

4. Take back our streets - so our high streets, small businesses and communities are thriving.

5. Break down barriers to opportunity - so every primary school family can access a breakfast club; we introduce a broader curriculum so our children become fitter for the future and expand training in skills and apprenticeships.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/116578/2c28a190-fb7b-4267-a679-763ee5a10ff3.png

My roots run deep in this city, having been raised, educated, and now working here. Leicester South isn’t just a place where I conduct business; it’s my heart , home, and commitment. 

For over 15 years, I have been privileged to serve our community through my award-winning optical practice and my community work.  This has given me a unique perspective on our city’s challenges and opportunities. I have witnessed firsthand the struggles of hard-working individuals and families as they try to make ends meet in the face of a rising cost of living. I have seen the strain on our NHS as it copes with increasing demand and limited resources. I have watched local businesses, our economy’s backbone, struggle to survive in an increasingly competitive market. I have seen the impact of neglect on our environment as we fail to take the necessary steps to protect and preserve it for future generations. But I also believe that Leicester South is a city of immense potential. We are a diverse and vibrant community, rich in culture and history. We have a strong sense of community spirit and a willingness to work together to overcome challenges. I believe that by harnessing these strengths and working together, we can build a brighter future for our city.

As your representative, I am committed to putting the needs of Leicester South first. I will not be beholden to party politics or special interests. My loyalty lies with you, the people of Leicester South. I will listen to your concerns, advocate for your needs, and work tirelessly to ensure that our city is a place where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. I am passionate about creating a fairer, more inclusive, and prosperous Leicester South. I believe that by working together, we can make this vision a reality. I am excited to embark on this journey with you, and I am confident that together, we can build a brighter future for Leicester South.

Please do not hesitate to contact me to share your concerns, ideas, or suggestions. I am here to listen, and I am here to serve you. Thank you for being so supportive, and I look forward to working with you to make Leicester South an even better place to live, work, and raise a family.

I am Craig Harwood, proud to stand as your Reform Party candidate for Leicester. An immigrant to the UK and a Leicestershire resident since 2001 - I‘ve called Braunstone Town and now, with my cherished family, Burbage, home.

My journey with the Reform party comes from my deep-rooted concern for the UK’s future and its current economic trajectory. Our political landscape is plagued by a self-serving elite who continue to neglect the welfare of the majority. As a parent I see a pivotal choice for this country: perpetual decline under the existing parties, or champion change with Reform UK.

I advocate for:

Economic Empowerment

Increasing the tax-free personal allowance to £20 000 Abolishing energy tax on household bills - saving £500 per household. NHS Transformation

Ending NHS Waiting lists by using independent healthcare providers. More medical professionals - Lifting the cap on the number of UK medical students. Affordable Energy

Scrap Nett Zero  End £10 Billion renewal subsidies for old renewable energy infrastructure Fast track North Sea Gas and oil permits and issue Shale Gas licenses to encourage price stability and security of supply.  Let’s make the next 4 years be better than the last 4 years. Together, let’s move forward to a future of higher wages, lower taxes and real growth. This is our contract with you.

The Big Two Parties have run out of energy and ideas on policing and protecting people’s security, failing to offer any different solutions.

The Big Two parties are tired and stale, they have abandoned local communities and are only interested with what happens in Westminster. That is why I am putting myself forward as the Green Party Candidate for Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland’s Police & Crime Commissioner.

If elected I will

Provide resources to keep everyone safe from harm — supporting the people who deal with crime on a daily basis.   Invest in services for victims of crime, particularly support for those suffering Domestic Abuse. Help to build strong communities by providing young people with the services to achieve their full potential and protect them from crime. The Green Party believes in well-funded public services, not a competition between the Big Two parties to see who can chase headlines while failing to invest in public safety.

When elected at a local, regional or national level, Greens have a track record of working hard for their communities and standing up for the most vulnerable.  I look forward to continuing this tradition if elected at May’s Police Commissioner election. 

If you want to change the way things are done and stand up for public service policing, please Vote Green for Police & Crime Commissioner on 2nd May.

As Chair of the Lewes Area Labour Party branch, I understand the challenges facing local people, so it is a privilege to represent the Labour Party in the area in which I live, where my partner is from, and the place that I call home.



I know how much people are suffering right now with the cost of living because I have personal experience of what it is like to grow up in poverty, being afraid to leave the house, because of crime. In my day job as a Trade Union Officer, supporting key workers such as NHS staff, I see how our public services are at breaking point. After 14 years of Conservative and Lib Dems in Government, the economy is faltering and nothing works.



I believe most people want to feel safe and secure in their home and in their neighborhood, in good quality housing, with public services that work, with opportunities for them and their family, not having to worry how they will pay the bills.

Scrap the Mayoral system which puts all the decision making in the hands of one person. Give back power to the local councillors who are more approachable.

Young people must be the priority – the council needs to run its own apprenticeship schemes for school leavers and employ staff directly to run council services – stop the contracting out to developers and multi-national corporations: Local jobs for local people. More resources for youth clubs to ensure that youngsters have positive experiences rather than being alienated and drifting into drugs, alcohol, gangs and violence.

The council should open under-5s playgroups which benefit the toddlers and, importantly, the parents, who learn good parenting skills from each other and are less isolated.

Climate Change: Take effective measures to combat climate change by making insulation of our homes a priority, cutting rising energy bills AND saving the planet. Hackney’s target of becoming carbon neutral by 2040 is way behind other London boroughs such as Lewisham. Blocking roads in Low Traffic Neighbourhoods just increases pollution elsewhere.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/56089.png

I am originally from the Ashby de la Zouch area and I started my career at East Midlands Airport as a cargo loader at the age of 17. I moved on to senior management positions within aviation related organisations based in the Middle East before becoming self-employed as an aviation safety consultant based in Bahrain.  During this time, I gained a PG Diploma in Training and Development and an MSc in Human Resource Development and Performance Management from the University of Leicester.

I have worked extensively throughout the Middle East, Africa and Asia which has given me a unique insight into the different approaches to governance in various cultures. In 2017 I was recognised as a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society due to my contributions to global aviation safety. This experience, in a highly regulated industry, has given me the skills needed when challenged by red tape bureaucracy. Contributing to public safety across a range of cultures has required tact and diplomacy and high levels of integrity. These are attributes that I endeavour to apply to everything that I do.

In 2019 I returned to the UK to be closer to my family but because of extraordinarily high house prices I decided to live on a narrowboat. I have been moored in Barton Marina ever since however I can often be found moored in Alrewas and Fradley enjoying nature as well as visiting local canal side hostelries.

During the covid pandemic my small business was not able to trade fully and I found it a struggle to make ends meet. Because of this, I know how difficult our day to day life can be especially during the cost of living crisis. The current political situation has resulted in many of us living on the edge like this every day but it shouldn’t have to be this way.

It seems that the main political parties have moved away from that which they traditionally stand for, especially the Conservative Party. By aiming to please everyone it is obvious they are pleasing no one. This has given me the motivation and desire to give my time to the people of the Lichfield constituency in the hope that we can work together in improving our quality of life and ensuring a more positive future.

Lichfield has been my home since before I learned to call a place home. I have had the absolute privilege over the last 33 years to learn in our local schools, shop on our local high streets and call many of our neighbours lifelong friends.

We are blessed to live in such a beautiful and historic part of our country, with stunning natural environments in places like Chasewater, Admaston, and along the Trent; with amazing architecture in the historic centre of Lichfield and in many of our villages; with the amazing people and communities that call Lichfield, Burntwood and our villages home, and who truly make our constituency all that it is.

Over the last 14 years, though, we have all seen our local area be let down by successive Conservative governments. The closure of local doctors’ surgeries, police stations and community venues; the lack of investment in our schools and our economy; the absence of any action on sewage spills in our waterways; a total failure to respect and support our high streets; and the worst cost of living crisis in living memory.

But it doesn’t have to be this way, we can rebuild and renew the infrastructure we rely on and the bonds between our community. That’s why I’m proud to be standing on a Labour Party platform offering a decade of national renewal, and for a mission led government that will change Britain for the better.

Together, on 4th July, we can turn a page on the inaction, sleaze and crisis of the last decade and half, we can vote for change which will get the NHS back on its feet, support our high streets and properly value our natural environment.

I chose to change from the Liberal Democrats to the Liberal Party for the reasons given below:

  Dear Elector ,   In April 2019 I formally left the Liberal Democrats and explained the   reasons for resigning:-      1. The party stance on   Brexit and unwillingness to recognise and provide a platform   for liberal leavers.     2. The   appalling internal communications emails which effectively   make it almost impossible   for activists and members to directly contact   officers.    3. The lack of promotion   of Town and Parish Councillors on an equal basis with other   member politicians.    4. The lack of new selection procedures to abolish central approval lists and the drafting in of candidates nationwide.(e.g  like you did  in Hazel Grove and other constituencies)    5. Deliberate obstruction  of electoral pacts with Liberals.    7. Complete  lack of public speaking out about the costs and political  intentions of the EU and therefore miss informing young  people of the dangers in the EU as opposed to the benefits  and potentially surrendering constitutional independence and  their future freedom and human rights in order to keep  MEP's, EU appointments and party funding.    Consequently, I  resigned my Liberal Democrat membership very sadly having  worked with officers and MP's since the time of Richard  Wainwright MP of Colne Valley....a great Liberal and am  consequently joining The Liberal Party as a Councillor and now  Parliamentary Candidate.    I very deeply regretted this but could no longer be identified with a party which so wilfully works against the express will of the people in a referendum it promoted and whose outcome it promised to observe 

I hope the above gives some useful information to those reading this site and is the same as printed in my local election material as is the personal information below.  You will also find me on YouTube at the time of the referendum on the EU membership and on the 'Centre' website formerly Liberal Leave.

Charles Shaw  (from my local town and parish leaflet) Charles Shaw has worked hard as a community activist and as local councillor for the last eight years and despite having been a Liberal Democrat spoke out in support of the Vote Leave Campaign and was the Vote Leave coordinator for the Lincoln area and has continued to speak out against the badly managed EU exit.  He campaigns often and speaks on the media regularly. Charles is a family man who equally speaks out about the total disregard for the traditions of our local communities in favour of bland government which is more concerned with politically correct processes than really helping.  As an environmentalist, he does not want our children to be part of ‘The Waste generation’ and believes happy families come from young people being shown how to manage for themselves and be given opportunities to grow as well as conform.   As chair of One East Midlands and of Lincolnshire Council for Voluntary Youth Services he leads the charge for better support for the voluntary sector which contributes so much to our community and upon which many depend. If you would like to talk to Charles about the current state of local government or politics or just give a hand in future campaigns please email electionmessage@outlook.com or telephone 07760 843910 or write to any of the addresses featured in this leaflet. Engagement in Politics is not just about the current General Election and Charles Shaw is keen to encourage more people to stand for local town, parish, district and county councils if you could like to do so yourself or are just thinking about it and would like to have an informal chat on the subject please do contact Charles Shaw who will be happy to help without obligation.

Charles Shaw (from my general election and next leaflets) Charles Shaw is a highly respected youth and community worker both locally and nationally with an extensive career covering business, local government and the Voluntary Sector. 

Experienced on Local Councils from Skellingthorpe to Bardney and a former elected member of a Drainage Board he is well aware of local community and environmental issues.

Charles Shaw is a ward resident and is married with grown up children. Experienced as a  Councillor and agent and staunchly against centralised control of local government, Charles believes Lincoln City should be a unitary authority working with but free of county domination.  Married (to Daphne) with three grown up children he is well aware of the issues facing families today. As Vote Leave co-ordinator for Lincoln, Sleaford and North Hykeham he successfully co-ordinated all-party effort to achieve a fantastic result in Central Lincolnshire whilst maintaining a friendly relationship across remain and leave activists and believes working together in a co-operative yet challenging way brings results. As a former Youth and Community officer with a Metropolitan Council for Racial Equality, he recognises the demographic changes that have taken place in Lincoln over the last decade and as Chair of the Centre for Reconciliation works promoting Community Cohesion and Inter-faith understanding across the County and beyond. As a councillor and politician he feels it is important to be the 'imp' who gets things done!

Livingston does not have any young councillors, at the age of 21, Cameron wants to break the barrier and give the young people of Livingston South a voice on the council.

He currently works for Green Co-Leader and MSP Lorna Slater in the Scottish Parliament as her Parliamentary Assistant. In this role Cameron regularly communicates with West Lothian Council as well as representatives from the Scottish Government. He has helped locals with a variety of issues such as planning cases and light pollution.

Cameron strongly believes that everyone should have access to a safe, warm and affordable home and is keen to push West Lothian further to achieve this. The introduction of an empty homes strategy to bring disused and abandoned properties back into use would be one of his main goals if elected in May.

My job was to keep the lights on and people safe.  From supplying the bedlinen, food and medical gasses to building brand new hospital wings and housing for our Armed Forces. My greatest achievements have been to rescue five people from the wreckage of a burning aircraft, house troops for the Olympic Games in 2012 and set up The Voice of Wales and of course Volunteering in support of the Army, building beds and decontaminating Ambulance’s during the pandemic.

Why have I stood  Unlike the other Candidate I have a proven track record of volunteering and helping out in the community, having just finished decontaminating Ambulances during the pandemic in support of the Army and prior to that building beds at the Dragon Heart Field Hospital. I am Chairman of Henllys Community Group and the Regional Co Ordinator for No. 13 (South Wales) Group Royal Observer Corps Association.   

 Labour have not only controlled the Council for many years but returned Councillors for Castle Ward year after year. The reward for such loyalty – The highest crime area in the Country – Swansea dubbed ‘Brown Town’ due to the amount of Heroin available on her streets – Aggressive begging from spaced out vagabonds who brawl and steal without let or hindrance Prostitutes and drug dealers openly plying there trade and the Council and South Wales Police believe ‘education’ is the path not prosecution just like the 21 girls who, (even in lockdown) where sexually assaulted and had genital mutilation inflicted upon their person because the ‘Partnership working’ doesn’t involve stopping this barbaric practice for fear I believe of being labelled ‘racist’. An outside Wales ‘Independent Audit’ of the Council needs to take place because to many Contracts are being given to too few firms and for a Contractors to go bust mid contract – like on the Kingsway development scheme I feel shows a level of ineptitude either by the Contracts department or the Council in general – I suspect both. 

What do you think the key issues are in your ward? The Council listening skills need to be improved for a start. We all saw the spectacle of Cllr Rob Stewart telling disabled people that is they didn’t like where they lived in Wind Street – to Move. People in specialist wheelchairs and other disabilities who have lived in Henllys for many years being told to ‘jog on’! 

Recovery from the Pandemic, must be a priority, with the needs of Business and Industry, understood and met. Small businesses and the fishermen have suffered the most. 

The Never-ending roadworks around the whole of Swansea are a joke yet Roads remain poor!  Swansea needs to get moving again and with herd immunity which we are told we now have should Guarantee ‘NO MORE LOCKDOWNS’. The terror of the traffic Warden scaring people out of shopping in Swansea hits businesses badly. People with Blue Badges should be allowed to park for free for three hours and people popping into shops for 1 hour.  All City Centre businesses waved business rates and market stallholders reduced rents. All paid from by cutting the spurious ‘voluntary groups – labours little helpers) funding and projects like the Taco Bridge which once completed will burden the Council Tax payers for years.  Real jobs with Trade Apprenticeships not row after row of coffee shops, fast food ,betting offices and charity shops. 

The unacceptable level of people high on drugs fighting and petty crime makes Castle Ward feel unsafe. This is simply Inexcusable. We need every part of the City to feel and to be safe.

Stopping the Council jumping on every bandwagon that comes along in particular BLM and Extinction Rebellion. It’s clear the Council through creative accounting will meet the above targets but the Child labour Costs are immeasurable as the electric vehicles are made from minerals mined by child slavery. 

What difference do you think you could make? I won’t be taking my constituents for granted. I will be keeping the Councils feet to the fire. We now have an Army of Local Government Officers yet we cannot keep Swansea tidy, safe or even pothole free. Swansea is a shadow of herself if anyone cares to look at the photographs of the 1950 and 60’s. Swansea was a place to come to. Now with Swansea as a City of Sanctuary and the swathes of immigrants loafing around the City Centre makes people feel unsafe and not a place to travel to as a holiday destination.

I was born on a hill sheep farm in the Highlands and have lived in Dunbar for nearly 6 years with my wife and our two kids, who go to local schools. I coach and referee at Dunbar mini rugby and volunteer in projects working for children in the care system. I want to be your MP because I deeply care about our community and believe in taking real action to make our lives better.

For most of the last fifteen years, I’ve been the CEO of Who Cares? Scotland. Where I fought for children in care who have been dealt the worst hand. Under my leadership we didn’t just talk about change—we made it happen. We showed that with care and action, we can transform lives. I’ve spent my life making a difference, from promoting democracy in Lithuania to tackling poverty in India and Ghana and building peace across former-Yugoslavia.

I’ve seen firsthand what happens when people fall through the cracks through no fault of their own—it’s unnecessary and unacceptable.

I want to be your MP, as I’ve seen too many politicians make empty promises, but they mostly get in the way instead of helping us thrive. The Liberal Democrats are different. We are fundamentally liberal. We respect people and will empower you to make a difference in your lives.

We have a local growing economy, but successive governments just interfere and make it harder for our businesses to thrive. We need policies that support growth without getting in the way. Small businesses are the backbone of our community, and they need fewer obstacles and more support.

Local green energy successes like the Berwick Bank wind farm should do more to benefit the local communities directly.

Schools should have the freedom to innovate and help our children succeed. Our healthcare system must be accessible and local, especially for end-of-life care. It’s unacceptable that community hospitals in Dunbar and North Berwick are closing, and this must be urgently addressed.

As your MP, I will deliver results. I’ve got a proven track record. I’ve delivered progressive solutions on budget and on time, showing that experience and passion can make a real difference.

It’s time we had quality people in the House of Commons, people who are competent and effective. I care about East Lothian and its people. I care about East Lothian’s stunning environment.

I became an Economist so I could make families more prosperous. I learnt my trade in the Treasury and gained a PhD. In my current day job at a think tank, I work on policies that will ensure every person in this country has enough money to thrive, public services they can rely on, and a Green New Deal that will get us to Net Zero with good jobs across the country.



I also spent two years working to end poverty inside the Somaliland government, one of the poorest and most fragile nations on earth. A nation where climate change is already leading to devastating droughts and starvation. I co-wrote their National Development Plan, economic policy, and budgets to help put them on the path to prosperity.



I've also taught children in disadvantaged schools. That doubled the chances of those kids getting into good universities. And as a trade union rep, I organised my members and stopped a 33% pay cut for my low-paid colleagues.



Service and hard work can create a better future. Those are the British values my family taught me. My grandfather served in the war, my parents started a business. Those are the values that I've lived my life by.



Those values are why I'm working so hard to win this election. To serve the people of Loughborough, Shepshed, and the Villages. To work tirelessly for a better, greener future.

“Instead of governing and solving our problems, the Tories squabble between themselves and fight over who their next leader will be. Enough is enough, time for a change. Vote for change, vote Liberal Democrat on the 4th of July.”",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/23553.png

Speaking after his selection, Jonathan Slater said;



""I'm very excited to have been selected as the Labour Parliamentary Candidate for Louth and Horncastle.""



""As someone who lives in a rural village I fully appreciate the challenges that many of my constituents have in the need to be able to access high-quality employment opportunities which I will campaign for - fighting for more affordable housing which is right for the constituency with the right community infrastructure, and finally lobbying for better national and local transport links to ensure all local constituents have the ability to travel to their place of work, as well as visit and support our local high streets.""



""Finally I want to highlight how our NHS been let down over the last 14 years, typified by the current MP and Secretary of State for Health, where I will highlight Labour's plans to cut the waiting lists, ensuring more in person GP appointments, and greater access to more NHS registered dentists.""

I was born in the Luton & Dunstable Hospital, I grew up in Biscot and went to Denbigh High School. I studied at Luton Sixth Form College before going to Leicester University. My first Saturday job was in Littlewoods in the Arndale (now Primark) and my first full-time job was at the TSB bank customer service centre that used to be on Cardiff Road. Later on in life, as part of my 20+ year career working in the public sector and wider civil service, I studied part-time for a Masters degree at the University of Bedfordshire in Luton.

I live in High Town with my partner Iain and, like you, I use our local services - I take the train from Luton Station, I shop locally (on High Town Road or Bury Park Sainsbury’s) and have gone to Woodland Avenue GP surgery since I was a baby! I'm involved in supporting our Luton community, as a governor at Luton Sixth Form College since 2014 and I'm a regular volunteer at Luton Foodbank.

Having spent my life in Luton, together with family and friends across the constituency, I know Luton like the back of my hand. I am a councillor on Luton Council, first elected over 8 years ago, currently representing High Town ward. I'm the Executive Member for Public Health.

I will be an MP who has real life experience, local credibility and a strong track record. And I believe it is imperative to be accountable to everyone you represent.

Since childhood I've always stood up for fairness and equality for all. This developed into a deep sense of social justice which I have held all my life. I have stood up for people's rights at work and against attacks on our pay and pensions.

We must tackle the inequalities between the very rich and the rest of us. Under Labour, our economy will work for the many. I have always advocated for democratic public ownership of key parts of our economy including our railways, energy, water and the Royal Mail. I am wholly opposed to the privatisation of our NHS and believe schools should be brought back under local authority control. We must put people before profit.

My mum and her mum before her, worked in our local NHS and I went to school in Poynton. It's a great area with great people, but Macclesfield has been taken for granted by the Conservatives for too long.



Our communities are confronting immense challenges: from the cost of living crisis to decaying public services, and the issue of our time -- the climate emergency. All of us have seen the decline of our town centre and the lack of attention paid to our rural communities. Meanwhile, prices are up and living standards are down. We face record NHS waiting times in Cheshire East and schools literally crumbling while the government stands by. As we've seen with the Bollin, sewage is being pumped into our rivers at an alarming rate. And our country's reputation abroad is at rock bottom.



The next election is an opportunity we don't want to miss. After 14 years in power, the Conservatives have crashed our economy, decimated our public services, and lost people's trust. Together we have a chance to have a Labour representative in parliament for the first time ever -- an MP who works for all our communities. I've beaten the Tories in their own backyard, now I want to do the same for my hometown. I want to see an area that's no longer neglected but supported to be the best possible place to live, work and grow old.

Together we can build a brighter future for Macclesfield.

Lib Dem members have selected Heybridge Councillor Simon Burwood as their candidate. Simon Burwood commented, “The Conservatives have run down our local health services, as we can see from their proposed changes at St Peter’s Hospital. It is a much-loved and vital community facility, which my family has used, including when my youngest daughter was born there.   “The Conservatives lack of investment has also led to long waiting times to see GPs, even longer waiting times for ambulances, a lack of NHS dentists (with people resorting to extracting their own teeth) and an increase in mental health issues, especially in our young people. “The NHS, once the envy of the world, is now on its knees.  We need to fix it and fix it fast. It will be a huge task, but the Lib Dems are ready for it and ready to give everyone the opportunity to get on in life, wherever they start. “Maldon has also seen many new homes being built recently. Young people desperately need affordable homes but the Conservative councils and Government have failed to deliver the essential infrastructure.”

Simon Burwood has lived in Heybridge for over 25 years raising three children and playing an active part in his local community. He is currently a Heybridge Parish Councillor and has served twice as Chair of the Council.  He was elected as a Councillor on Maldon District Council for Heybridge West, in May 2023.  He is currently the President of the Heybridge Blackwater Rotary Club, which raises funds for local, national and international charities.   Simon works in adult education and manages community engagement, wellbeing, family learning and courses for adult learners with disabilities and difficulties for an Essex local authority.  In previous roles, he has managed apprenticeship programmes, working with younger people to develop their skills, knowledge, and behaviours for the workplace.    Simon believes that everyone, no matter their age, needs support to develop and achieve their potential and the Liberal Democrats’ pledge of a Skills Wallet for every adult to learn and develop is important to him. The Liberal Democrats are the second largest political party in Maldon and thus the clear challengers to the Conservatives.  A vote for Simon Burwood and the Liberal Democrats is a vote for the change that Britain desperately needs after 14 years of the Conservatives.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/85029/7fd9adeb-f056-4f05-a19e-c4e6920fa2b0.png

As an NHS PHARMACIST and STUDENT DOCTOR, Parham has seen firsthand the challenges our health service faces. He is deeply committed to improving the NHS, addressing the housing crisis, and advocating for the people of Gaza who are enduring unimaginable suffering.

In Manchester Central, the NHS faces significant and URGENT challenges. Hospitals across Greater Manchester are so cash-strapped each month that they are having to receive advance payments from the region’s NHS to keep services running. The region’s NHS is already under close scrutiny by national NHS bosses over its near-£180m DEFICIT, which it is under strict instructions not to allow to get worse. Several trusts are potentially RUNNING OUT OF CASH, and this financial strain is affecting the quality of care provided to our community. This situation is unacceptable and requires IMMEDIATE action.

Parham is committed to FULLY RENATIONALISING the NHS, ensuring it is funded adequately and managed efficiently. Our health service should be a beacon of hope and care, FREE from the grasp of private profiteers. He will fight to restore DECENT PAY LEVELS for our healthcare workers, ensure that patient care is NEVER COMPROMISED by budget cuts or private interests, and guarantee that NHS DENTISTRY is accessible and affordable for all. Together, we can make the NHS the PRIDE OF OUR NATION once more.

The HOUSING CRISIS in Manchester Central is a dire issue that needs immediate attention. Every person deserves a SAFE and AFFORDABLE place to call home. Parham will work tirelessly to initiate a COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMME OF SOCIAL HOUSING, overriding unnecessary planning constraints and ensuring the right to buy or transfer sub-standard buy-to-let properties to local authorities. We must end the scandal of young people being PRICED OUT OF THEIR OWN CITY and ensure that everyone has access to DECENT, AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

The conflict in GAZA is a HUMANITARIAN CRISIS that demands our attention and action. As your representative, Parham will not shy away from SPEAKING THE TRUTH. The people of Gaza are suffering due to a BRUTAL ONSLAUGHT enabled by complicit governments, including our own. Parham stands unequivocally with the people of PALESTINE, advocating for a SINGLE STATE where all those born in PALESTINE-ISRAEL can live in PEACE with EQUAL RIGHTS. We must end the ILLEGAL OCCUPATION and support the RIGHT OF RETURN for all displaced Palestinians. Our foreign policy should reflect our values of JUSTICE and HUMAN RIGHTS.

Parham was an EX-LABOUR MEMBER who felt that Labour STOPPED REPRESENTING THE EVERYDAY PEOPLE. LABOUR NEEDS TO LEARN that it cannot TAKE VOTES FOR GRANTED. For instance, the current Labour MP for Manchester Central, Lucy Powell, abstained from voting for a ceasefire in Gaza, highlighting Labour’s failure to stand up for justice and peace.

Manchester Central deserves a representative who will FIGHT FOR THE NHS, tackle the HOUSING CRISIS, and stand up for JUSTICE IN GAZA. Parham Hashemi is that representative. Together, we can create a FAIRER, MORE COMPASSIONATE society. Vote for PARHAM HASHEMI and the WORKERS PARTY, and let’s make REAL CHANGE happen.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/116679/8117dfcc-c15e-47fe-a4d4-5af90b260355.png

As a parent with children in Mansfield during the 1997-2010 Labour Government, I saw the profound impact that action by Labour in government can have on working-class families. It gave my family access to high quality education, the lowest NHS waiting times ever and a growing economy that made our lives better.

I want to inspire the people of Mansfield with a fresh message that Labour is on their side, upholds their values, and wants them to win. I have the drive and resilience to win here and the values and experience to match.

Like many areas across our country, Mansfield isn't thriving right now, but it can with a Labour MP under a new Labour Government.

As a volunteer, active member of our community and lifelong trade unionist, I have always strived to make things better. From being a school governor, volunteering for local charities that make a difference for adult social care and domestic violence, and supporting our local Credit Union. I've organised, campaigned and delivered positive change throughout my life.

Our shared values are under threat right now. We have a Tory MP who doesn't live here and doesn't act in our interests. For 14 years we have had Conservative Government that has failed us.

I am now asking for your vote, and your faith in me, to become the Labour Member of Parliament for Mansfield. Together, we can make a real difference for our community.

I wanted to take this opportunity to introduce myself to you.

I was born in Leicester, grew up in Melton Mowbray and have fond memories of my time here. My parents still live in Melton, and I’m a regular visitor to the area. 

I’m also a dad of two, a school governor and a mentor for the Prince’s Trust. When I get the time, I enjoy football and travelling.

I believe in putting people first and helping them to fulfil their potential - so that we can all achieve what we want to in life. But too many people aren’t getting the opportunity to do that at the moment.  That’s why I’m convinced it’s time for change in Melton and Syston. 

I know that getting a GP and dentist appointment in our area is incredibly hard, and waiting times for ambulances are putting lives at risk.

I see first-hand the damage that the Conservatives have done to our education system and the impact that’s having on young people.

And I'm shocked that the government is letting water companies get away with dumping sewage in our precious waterways, while its policy on tackling climate change is going backwards. Labour is also wavering on its promises and not sure what to do. 

The list goes on and makes for depressing reading.

To make things worse, many of our politicians refuse to take responsibility for their mistakes.  Their arguments often become personal and nasty, and all this behaviour puts people off politics.  Unfortunately, this last parliament will be remembered for scandal rather than solutions – and the whole country is paying the price.

Melton and Syston residents deserve better.  From the conversations that we’ve been enjoying with residents over the past few months, it’s clear that people have had enough.  The next step is for you to use your vote later this year to choose an MP who’ll stand up for you and start putting things right.  

Who do you think is best placed to do that?  Is it the Conservatives - the party that created the mess we’re all facing?  Is it Labour - the party that’s admitted it can’t win in Melton and Syston so is focusing its attention elsewhere in the East Midlands?  Or is it time for fresh thinking with the Lib Dems?",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/43364/fb671580-7c2a-4474-bb68-a2e84c6a4361.png

I promise to continue to be that Labour change. I will work twice as hard to deliver for you, I will put you first, and I will fight for communities that work. Communities where you can rely on local NHS services, where you can trust that new development will be in your interest, and where you aren’t in fear of rural crime, because you know that your elected representative doesn’t take your vote for granted and is committed to you.

And that’s because Bedfordshire is where I was born, grew up, and where my family rebuilt our lives after years of struggle. Through hard work, we had the opportunity to turn our lives around under a Labour government. Today, I’m a banker from a working class background with experience in the private sector financing governments, my sister is an NHS doctor, and my husband has a background in small business.

But I don’t believe in doing well for myself and forgetting about the community that got me to where I am today. That’s why I’m standing - I owe it to you to be the hardest working MP that our towns and villages have ever seen, starting immediately. I am here every single day, full time, meeting with as many of you as possible.

In Mid Cheshire, we have one in five children living in poverty. A child born in my ward in Leftwich will have a life expectancy ten years lower than one born just a couple of miles away on the other side of town.

I've chosen to dedicate my life to our community because I believe that every child should have the opportunity to reach their full potential.

Moulton is almost equal distance from our three great Salt Towns of Middlewich, Northwich and Winsford and all of them have been important to me and my family over the years. My wife taught in Middlewich, my three children have all attended Northwich schools, and I play walking football with Winsford Town.

I’ve been active working in different parts of the community; as a parish councillor; working with the police and local authority on community safety; on the liaison group for the local hazardous waste facility in the salt mine. And after being ordained in the Church of England in 2017 I was the curate at St Helens in Northwich and vicar at St Stephen’s in Moulton until September last year.

What drives me is a commitment to speaking out against injustice and inequality. It could be the water companies paying out millions in dividends while they put raw sewage in our rivers; the system that allows people to make obscene sums of money, while others have nothing; the targeting of people fleeing to our country to escape the economic and political mess that we have failed to help and address in their own countries; or the biggest issue of all, the climate emergency that will make huge parts of the world unliveable, will lead to mass migration by those who have the least and will disrupt every part of our lives.

Only The Green Party have the policies, the principles and the people to address these issues, and I’m honoured to be asking my friends and neighbours in this area, that if these are the issues that concern you,

I’ll fight for East Cleveland communities like Loftus and Lingdale that feel abandoned and ignored. I’ll champion growth, jobs and investment.

Those are my local priorities. But we also need to think about the national consequences of our vote.

My beliefs aren’t complicated. I believe in the value of hard work and taking responsibility. I believe in living within our means and not piling up debt for our children. And I believe in a strong, independent Britain which is a force for good in the world.

Those are the values of thousands of people in Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland who feel Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party has totally stopped speaking for them.

We should be clear: every vote for another candidate in this election is a vote for Jeremy Corbyn in Number 10, negotiating our Brexit deal and responsible for our economy and our security. That is a risk we simply must not take.

I am the only candidate here who will work with Theresa May to deliver the strong leadership we need, and a better future for our area and our country.

While the main parties bicker over the the Union Vs Independence debate some real leadership in Holyrood is sorely lacking.

I believe that we need to rebuild the society by rebuilding the family. We need to eliminate perverse sex education in schools which robs children of their most innocent years. We need men to man up and take responsibility for their their own life choices. This means being role models to their children. Showing their sons how to treat women properly and showing their daughters how they ought to be treated. 

Motherhood and fatherhood should be promoted as the blessing that it truly is.

The differences between man and woman should be celebrated rather than forcefully equalised by the policies or the ruling party. If a man wishes to be the sole provider and let his wife nurture and raise their children full time then this should be viewed positively.

Finally it is very important to maintain involvement in the local community. I'm very passionate about local issues myself and if anyone in the Strathkelvin and Bearsden constituency or West Scotland Region is particularly passionate about a local issue then I want to hear all about it so please do get in touch!

That's 2,446 childhoods I'm dedicating myself to changing. As an Executive Director at one of the world's biggest children's charities I lead a team of 160 to deliver award-winning campaigns and our programmes supporting families here in Scotland and across the UK.

I absolutely love my job but there's nothing I can do in it that will ever make as big a difference to our communities as Labour in government does. That's what's brought me back from community work to politics.

I was proud to work as a Downing Street adviser to Gordon Brown during the financial crisis, translating action at the G20 right down to where it made a difference, in protecting people's pensions, jobs, savings and homes.

Now I'm the chair of the advisory board for Our Scottish Future, giving a voice to everyone who wants to keep our country together but wants -- and needs -- change. I also volunteer on the boards of IPPR, The Center for Countering Digital Hate, The Labour Climate and Environment Forum, Larger Us, The Civic Power Fund and The Climate Coalition. The thing that brings all of this together is my belief that it doesn't have to be like this: that if we focus on what unites us we can meet and master the great challenges of the day. We have the chance to draw a line under the division and distraction of the past - and to inspire the Scottish people with the kind of future we will build together.

A Scottish decade where we have good green jobs, modern manufacturing and where talent - not class - determines what happens in the classroom. A future where we see growth not just in our economy but in our ambitions - where we create a Scotland where no child is hungry, no family is cold and each generation does better than the last. That's what we're fighting for - that's what's on the ballot paper at the general election. I'd love for you to be part of it. Please get in touch and let's get started.

My passion is working in the community, bringing people together and solving problems. 14 years of Conservative governments have left the UK in a desperate state. Public services are barely working, and we've had a succession of Prime Ministers acting as if the rules don't apply to them.



We can do better. As part of a Labour government, I want to help rebuild Mid Sussex. Transform the NHS, revitalise public services, and create water, power and rail networks that put consumers first, not shareholders.



I can only do this with your help.

We need a Labour MP to make sure we get our fair share from the next Labour government.

The latest polling shows the Lib Dems are now a distant third place; only Labour can beat the Conservatives here. I ask that you give me a chance to show you what I can do.

This is personal to me -- my family work in our local public services, my mum as a teacher and my brother as a firefighter. I've seen first-hand how more than a decade of Tory policy has undermined their craft and the services they provide.

Born to a Filipina and a Briton, Pippa moved from Manila to Morden in 1977 and, after some time away, returned to the borough of Merton in 2013. Angered by pernicious ‘austerity measures’ imposed by the coalition government, she joined The People’s Assembly Against Austerity. Determined to fight cuts to essential local services, particularly in adult social care and at St Helier Hospital, she threw herself into campaigning.

In 2015, Pippa and her neighbours found themselves having to fight their housing association, Clarion, to lower a bill for major works. The ward Councillors proved ineffective. Thus, the residents took matters into their own hands and managed to negotiate about 60% off the original figure. In the same year, she joined the National Health Action Party because she felt compelled to counter unjust cuts to local healthcare and the burgeoning backdoor privatisation of our NHS.

A move to the Green Party came shortly after and, in 2017, Pippa was a candidate in a by-election for the ward in which she lives. Since then, she has represented her ward in subsequent council elections and stood as the Mitcham and Morden candidate for the General Election in 2019, as well as the London Assembly candidate for Merton and Wandsworth in 2021 and 2024.

Notably, after encountering, in late 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Special Report on Global Warming, the next year saw Pippa create and lead a successful petition to Merton Council to declare a climate emergency and review its current carbon reduction plans for the borough to help to limit global warming to 1.5°C - going on to work with the Council, as part of a Climate Emergency Working Group, to create a Climate Strategy and Action Plan.

More recently, Pippa has: worked with a grassroots group whose central aim is to lobby for and shape improvements in infrastructure for active travel in Merton; helped a coalition of residents’ associations and individuals opposing the All England Lawn Tennis Club’s excessive proposal to expand its site; supported residents in Mitcham to reject an inappropriate plan for the old gasworks site; and attended peace vigils and marches calling for a bilateral ceasefire and the release of all hostages in Israel and Gaza. Further to this, she belongs to Friends of Morden Recreation Ground and, after a few years of joining up with neighbours to protect Morden Park from inappropriate commercial use, now sits on the committee for Friends of Morden Park.

Outside of work and activism, Pippa loves to walk, watch birds, learn about wildlife, eat out, and listen to music.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/86452/8c3c24b6-fcc0-4439-aa91-b403017e2881.png

A graduate of the University of Wales, Swansea, 1987 June holds a degree in History and English Literature. June also holds an MSc in Tourism Management from UWIC, Cardiff and a PGCE/QTS in Business Studies and Economics. June is a passionate educator who has taught in Cardiff, Monmouth and the Forest of Dean working in the secondary school sector to inspire young people to develop their passions through enterprise activities. June currently serves her local community in Redbrook as a parish councillor.

In 2019 she stood as a candidate in the Newport West by-election and European Parliament elections as a vocal proponent of the need for political reform to end corruption in politics. June is passionate about driving grassroots participation in civic life, the need to protect the environment and improving civic engagement in her community.

In her leisure time June sings with a local community choir, enjoys live music and heritage in the outdoors. The True & Fair Party was launched by Gina Miller earlier in 2022 to tackle political corruption an institutional weaknesses, and campaign for the modernisation of UK democracy.

June's top 3 local priorities are:

Save our Rivers - The fragile ecosystems of the Wye, Usk and Severn and their tributaries are in crisis as a result of the expansion of intensive farming, an inadequate regulatory framework and systemic failures of water utilities to invest in solutions to inadequate combined sewage overflows and surface water drainage.

Affordable Homes and Cost of Living Crisis Beating Local Jobs

Joined up, cross border thinking on planning and infrastructure investment is needed urgently to build sustainable, affordable housing with a well connected transport and community infrastructure that meets the needs of future generations

As Chief Executive of a charity campaigning for a fairer Wales, I'm proud to have doubled our funding and grown our impact in recent years, winning important campaigns as well as two National awards.

Monmouth's residents are some of the kindest and fairest that I have known but they do not have a government in Westminster who treats them fairly. Monmouth needs an MP who is committed to strengthening the economy to fix the chaos caused by the Tories over the past 13 years, an MP who can make Monmouth fairer, bringing funding to the area to regenerate our high streets and invest in public services, as well as an MP who will take the climate emergency seriously.

Together, it's time to build a stronger, fairer, greener Monmouth Constituency.

I'd love to answer any questions you may have or please do get in touch to help us win Monmouth for Labour.

I used to work in care and ever since I found out about the council trying to sell Tudor Street Day Centre for flats, I have been campaigning to stop this happening. The building is fit for purpose with accessibility and facilities that support adults with complex needs. The campaign started in 2022 and is still ongoing.

I have worked with a team to put together a community group called The Gathering, which currently meets regularly at the Wellbeing Hub. That location, whilst good for now, is still not accessible for people with complex needs. Other services, like Budden Crescent, have been closed, and this has severely affected the service users, their families and staff. 

If elected, I will continue to fight for better services and support for vulnerable adults, and I will also push for fit-for-purposes buildings to give these vulnerable people a place to go and get better opportunities.

The Green Party is the only party addressing the climate emergency with the seriousness it deserves. It is the defining issue of this generation and if we do not drastically cut our carbon emissions our grandchildren will inherit a wrecked planet.

In 2015, world leaders in Paris agreed that to prevent widespread future famine, loss of life and more and dangerous extremes in weather patterns - we need to keep the mean temperature rise below 1.5°C.  However, we have already breached this target in 2023 and global carbon emissions are still rising. The effect of El Niño last year may mean a temporary dip below 1.5°C again but the trend is upwards and this illustrates how serious the situation is.

That said, the Green Party has never been just about climate change - it is also the party of social justice – the two are inextricably linked.  We need to rapidly rethink how we enable a smooth transition to a low carbon economy alongside reform of our services to create a just and fair society so I look forward to sharing our ideas on health, education, farming, housing, transport and other policy areas over the next few months.

My background is that for the last 10 years I have worked for social enterprises setting up community energy schemes and delivering domestic energy efficiency advice, but my early career was in analysis of the transmission system with National Grid.

I was fortunate to have access to a good university education, and believe that education is the key to all other aspects of a compassionate society. Without a top-class education system we will not have the engineers, doctors, nurses, and yes, wise and compassionate politicians of the next generation.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/26984/736fc237-87ba-4de4-8817-7d796d67d719.png

Waiting lists are at record highs. So is the tax burden. Crime, child poverty, and homelessness are all rising. We have become less prosperous compared to other major economies. Court backlogs and a lack of investment in prisons means our justice system is on its knees. The same is true for most public services, not least our buckling National Health Service.

Five Tory prime ministers have given us austerity, a cost-of-living crisis, a stagnant economy, and international isolation. They are not a serious party of government and we cannot risk another five years of Tory chaos.

My whole life is in this constituency. I teach its amazingly bright and talented children and raise my own in Acrefair. We have so much going for us, whether it is Ruabon’s proud industrial heritage, the grandeur of Powis and Chirk castles, Machynlleth’s art, festivals, and culture, or Rhosllanerchrugog’s strong vibrant Welsh community.

This election will be the first contested under new constituency boundaries, which have completely changed the political landscape here. The Liberal Democrats may in the past have been the traditional alternative to the Tories in Montgomeryshire, but with the addition of 13 Labour-voting wards in the north of our new constituency, on top of their plummeting vote share since 2010, this is simply no longer the case – a vote for them is now a vote to let the Tories sneak back in.

Montgomeryshire & Glyndŵr deserves so much better. Tory economic incompetence has decimated public finances and our local economies. Mid Wales has lost its Air Ambulance base. Welshpool had no banking access whatsoever for a whole year. There is still no health hub in Newtown.

For a region so dependent on reliable transport links, this Tory decline has hit us particularly hard. Rural bus services have halved in the past decade and a half. For Llanidloes, the only large town in Montgomeryshire without a train station, this causes pointless delays with the bus to Caersws missing connecting trains by minutes.

I am unashamedly proud of our farmers, who do so much for our local economy. Here again, Tory incompetence has hit us where it hurts, with Boris Johnson’s disastrous trade deal with Australia selling out the farming community. His successor as prime minister, Liz Truss, said he had “conceded the whole kingdom” with the deal. We welcome the news that rural voters are increasingly considering voting Labour. We will not take your support for granted and will support Welsh farmers by reducing the reliance on imported food and by cutting red tape at the border.

Labour has brought Britain back from the brink before. We will do so again. With Labour governments in Westminster, Cardiff Bay, and with a Labour MP in Montgomeryshire & Glyndŵr, we will work together to bring about a decade of renewal.

I will be a loud voice in Westminster for properly funding public services, most importantly our NHS. I will support restrictions on shameful corporate lobbying and back Labour’s plans to abolish the House of Lords. As a trade unionist since age 19 and current executive member of my trade union, I will back public sector workers to the hilt and stand up for workers’ rights. I fully support the creation of Great British Energy and the nationalisation of our railways, which I will leverage to bring cheap, clean energy and more reliable train services into our communities. I will call for an ambitious Green New Deal and make sure we protect our party democracy. I will work with MPs of any stripe in Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Radnorshire, Wrexham, Shropshire and Ludlow to keep our communities connected and drive the growth of our local economies.

Polls are showing a very close race between Labour and the Tories. If you are a Lib Dem, Plaid, or Green voter, we need you to lend us your vote so we can send a clear message to Rishi Sunak, who’s parliamentary private secretary is our very own Tory MP Craig Williams. He and his colleagues have taken rural, traditional areas like ours for granted. 14 years later and we desperately need change. A vote for Labour is a vote for that change.

From Rhos and Ruabon to Llanfyllin and Llangurig, in Chirk, Cefn, Welshpool, Machynlleth, and everywhere inbetween, I will be an MP for all of Montgomeryshire & Glyndŵr. I will fight tirelessly to secure our place in a more prosperous, safer, and greener Wales.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/116488/8af4cef2-8236-4e67-ac25-5613190f9cab.png

Lizzi was born near Blackburn but grew up in a small village in Cumbria. She moved to the area in 2005 and now lives in Heysham with her husband and two kids.



A project manager by trade, Lizzi is an experienced representative having been elected to Lancashire County Council in 2016 where she now serves as Shadow Cabinet Member for Health and Wellbeing. Lizzi is also the Deputy Chair of Lancashire Health and Adult Services Scrutiny Committee. She is passionate about health and ensuring that health is considered in all areas of policy.



With a reputation for empathy, hard work and tenacity, Lizzi enjoys widespread support across the new constituency. After her selection Lizzi said: ""I hope to win people's trust to represent them in Westminster and to help deliver the change our country so desperately needs. People are fed up of public services that are run into the ground and an economy that doesn't work for them, especially when the Government doesn't seem to care about basic decency and honesty. People have been badly let down.



""People in Morecambe and Lunesdale deserve an MP who will fight their corner and I plan to be a great constituency MP.""



In her spare time Lizzi is a keen gardener, growing her own fruit and veg and making her own preserves.

In the past she worked for local charities: for people with drug and alcohol issues, SCOPE, and more recently a charity in Cumbria trying to make church buildings more sustainable. Her primary career was in the NHS in public health project management. In addition to being a councillor she now works very part-time as a personal assistant for someone with disabilities.

One of her proudest achievements is playing a key part in getting Lancaster funded for massive improvements to cycling (£1.5 million); and in 2002 daring to expose the City Council's secret decision to give financial support to the nuclear industry (which resulted in her being suspended from the Council for three months although meanwhile re-elected with a bigger majority).

On Lancashire County Council she has been proud to support those fighting the shale gas industry on the Fylde - and to shine a light on the real risks that fracking brings. She does not shy away from meaningful action, and in addition to her numerous interventions and motions at full council and in the democratic process she was arrested and charged for obstruction of the highway in direct action outside the Preston New Road site in November 2017.

The Conservative slogan is “Britain deserves better.” Yes, better than the nine years of Tory rule that has brought this country to its knees.

That’s why I have recently joined the Labour Party and am standing to be your MP. The country is in crisis but the good news is that it is not too late. I support Labour’s ambitious election campaign - the most ambitious and radical our country has ever seen. If you want to live in a society that works for everybody and not just the billionaires, this election is your chance to vote for it.

We, the Labour Party, put our faith in the British people’s spirit and commitment to community. Wealth and power should not be in the hands of the many Boris Johnson’s Conservatives, who think they’re born to rule. They’ve slashed taxes for the richest and slashed vital services and support for everyone else. 

This election is a once-in-a generation chance to take on the vested interests holding people back and to transform our country, making sure that no community is left behind. To do this we are making these pledges: •	A properly-funded and resourced National Health Service we can all be proud of •	A social care system that gives our older people both dignity and free personal care •	A real living wage of at least £10 an hour, from the age of 16 •	Secure homes that families can afford •	Thirty hours’ free childcare for all two to four-year olds •	A good education as a right, not a privilege – and with no tuition fees - where children with special educational needs get the free education they deserve •	Efficient and affordable rail, mail and water services, owned by the public rather than the rich making themselves richer •	A chance for all voters to have a final say on Brexit because in a democracy it’s OK to change your mind •	An end to Tory austerity and Universal Credit •	An end to tax havens, dodgy landlords and bad bosses •	Real action on the climate emergency, with a Green Industrial Revolution at the heart of Labour’s plan to transform Britain

And when Labour wins, the nurse wins, the doctor wins, the pensioner wins, the student wins, the office worker wins, the engineer wins, the child wins. We all win.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/72027.png

'My wife and I both work in the local area, and our children go to local schools. We access the same services, local doctors, schools and public transport as you, and like you, we demand better from our government on the issues we all face locally and nationally. I want to see a West Berkshire that is confident for a brighter future, which is why I invite you to join me in demanding better.'

Lee became politically motivated to join the local Liberal Democrats in 1999 at the age of 16 when David Rendel was MP for Newbury. Personally seeing the positive differences that were made to the local community, Lee was inspired to become a councillor in Thatcham in 2007. Since then, he has been Mayor twice, Leader of Thatcham Town Council, and is currently the Leader of the Opposition on West Berkshire Council fighting for a better deal from central government to help fund our vital local services.

With a proven track record of standing up for residents, Lee continues to hold the Tories to account. ‘Our District has missed out on much need affordable housing and we have unnecessarily lost many community assets including Newbury football Club. We have also seen hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers money being wasted defending incompetent decisions in court.’

With continued and significant electoral success for West Berkshire and Newbury Liberal Democrats, Lee and the Liberal Democrats are standing up for voters on important areas such as housing, education and the environment. Under Lee’s leadership they won widespread support from the people of West Berkshire, increasing their representation on West Berkshire Council almost fourfold and regained control of both Newbury and Thatcham town councils. 

Lee is committed to the community and people of West Berkshire and continues to stand up for our area. Your support can make the difference in giving West Berkshire a hardworking, committed local MP that will work for you.

We need common-sense, practical solutions to the biggest challenges of our time.

As a mental health worker in a Walker-based GP practice, I see the impact of 14 years of austerity every day. I see people with mental health difficulties sat on waiting lists, unable to get the support they need. I see the stress of low wages and rising rents driving people to despair, alongside NHS staff burnt out trying to meet the needs of patients. I also see community services doing their best to provide support despite never-ending funding cuts. It is clear to me the growing mental health crisis is inextricably linked to an economy that serves the very few at the expense of the many.

Despite these challenges, we have so much to be proud of in Newcastle East and Wallsend. We have a rich industrial heritage, a long history of solidarity and our famous warmth and good humour. I’m always struck by the resilience of the people I work with and I believe that given the opportunity, our communities can thrive. 

The Green Party vows to empower communities and fix the climate crisis alongside the growing crisis of inequality. We will invest in renewable energy to improve energy security and reduce both energy bills and emissions. We will build thousands of affordable houses and insulate existing ones, to make sure that everyone can live in a safe, warm home. We will provide affordable public transport to help people stay connected, improve air quality, and leave more money in your pocket. We will bring vital services like water back into public hands to protect our shared environment. The Green Party will always place people before profit.

Be invested in minimising the effects of climate change and in protecting the environment

Help the young and vulnerable avoid falling into illegal activities including County Lines

Push for robust mental health support across the New Forest, currently tragically under resourced

Work hard on providing more accessible help to victims of domestic violence and abusive relationships

Its multiple failures have seen it lose the confidence of the public. Its canteen culture has seen numerous police investigated for gross misconduct, a revolving door of people resigning before they can be sacked. There have been calls for it to be put into special measures or subject to an independent investigation. The force is still subject to a number of ongoing investigations, including one into the toxic culture revealed in text messages given to The Times newspaper. There was a damning Police Inspectorate report in 2023, revealing multiple failures in the force.

But you do not need Police watchdogs and media to realise Gwent Police is failing, you can use your eyes.  My own inner city ward in Newport was a quiet safe area a decade ago, but now it feels abandoned by the police. When issues are raised the response from the police is arrogant and condescending.

If elected I would make sure:

•   The new Chief Constable is recruited from outside the force;

•   We return to community policing, talking to the public rather than hiding from them. Encourage Neighbourhood Watch schemes;

•   We investigate all crimes, experience has shown dealing with minor crime reduces all crime;

•   Senior management needs shaking up, see the 2023 Inspectorate report;

•   Recruitment vetting needs to be fit for purpose, we do not want any Wayne Couzens here;

•   Consider reopening police station front desks, we need the police and public to be in direct contact;

•   Sort out the 101 phone number mess, it is currently not fit for purpose;

•   Put more resources into solving crime, Gwent Police’s conviction rate is a joke

Rishi Sunak's out of touch Conservative government has crashed the economy, trashed Britain's public services and burdened hardworking families in Newton Abbot with the highest taxes since the second world war.



The promise of a Labour government has never been cause for greater optimism for families across Newton Abbot. Keir Starmer's pledge to build 1.5 million new homes, establish GB Energy to make Britain a clean energy superpower, create a new publicly owned railway company Great British Rail, offer 2 million more NHS appointments per year to clear the backlog offers the people of Newton Abbot a stark alternative to the chaos and mismanagement of the last 14 years.



As someone who works locally in hospitality, I am passionate about Labour's vision for the future of work where working people enjoy dignity, gain security, receive respect, and are supported to prosper. The Labour Party has a long and proud history of being the Party not just of working people but for working people. From day one, a Labour government will strengthen workers' rights and make Britain work for working for people in Newton Abbot. Our country remains riven by inequalities which Labour is focused on fixing -- to ensure the working people who create our nation's wealth get their fair share of it.



I'm standing to give Newton Abbot the fresh start it so desperately needs. It's time for change in South Devon and I am determined to fight tooth and nail and give everything I have to represent the people of Newton Abbot as the town's MP and provide the effective local representation we so desperately need.

Climate change! Of course, very on brand for us Greens. Public transport is a big issue in the area, especially out in Featherstone. There are train and bus services, but trains can be infrequent and are expensive! Some subsidised travel on public transport and better provisions for active transport (footpaths, protected cycle lanes etc) would help reduce personal vehicle use in the area, decreasing traffic and increasing air quality. What difference do you think a Green Party Councillor could make in Featherstone? I think that it’s important that Labour are held to account in Featherstone. Labour councillors are constantly elected in Featherstone without too much contest from other parties. A Green councillor in the ward would put pressure on Labour to be active in their area and work hard for the people they represent. What five words (or phrases) best describe you as a prospective councillor? Hard working, dedicated, trustworthy, focused and willing to stand up for issues that voters are facing! How would a Green approach help ordinary people to better manage the cost of living? 1. Retrofitting. Rolling out insulation in all existing properties to ensure that heating bills are as low as possible by ensuring the heat stays in! 2. Investment in renewable energy. No more oil and gas power stations, with massive emissions and unsightly cooling towers, and instead moving to solar and wind power, which is the cheapest (and of course cleanest!) source of energy. 3. Implementing a Universal Basic Income. Replacing the current Universal Credit system which is not fit for purpose with a new UBI system, guaranteeing a decent basic income for everyone.

He has also always held liberal philosophies such as the right to live your life without fear or prejudice whilst also respecting the principles of avoiding or minimising harm to others caused by your or someone else’s actions. As he grew up his ideas evolved and matured, as they do for everyone, through the benefits of lived experience and the challenges that life always throws at you. Chris was brought up in a safe and secure environment and spent much of his youth as part of the Red Cross supporting many areas of the community. He was educated at the Royal Grammar School in High Wycombe where he was lucky to visit Germany, France and Russia and had the harrowing experience of seeing the Berlin Wall before its fall. He decided to leave home at 18 and sought to build a new life with his then fiancée, Justine. They moved several times during their lives, living and working in many parts of the UK including London, Kent, Buckinghamshire, Clackmannanshire, Livingston and, most recently, Northamptonshire where they decided to finally settle and start a family. Their son, Michael, was born after they were married for nearly 20 years and he is now studying at the University of Northampton. Chris has also worked in many other countries including France, Spain, India, Fiji, Mauritius, the Middle East and the United States as part of roles based in the UK. These experiences helped to round out his understanding of many parts of the UK and the wider world and their cultures.

His father was based on a Minesweeper during the second half of the Second World War and helped fight to preserve our democratic freedoms from the oppression of the extreme right wing and fascism. In recent years these have been under attack from within, with many tactics used in autocratic states seeding their way into life in the UK. This, along with the antiquated First Past the Post electoral system has put our basic human rights and freedoms under attack, invisible to many, like the frog in the boiling pot. Chris decided that enough was enough, he could no longer leave protecting our health, security and inalienable freedoms to the Conservatives, and does not trust Labour to be brave enough to lead us back to our basic British ideals of fairness, care and inclusivity, preferring achieving and staying in power rather than persuade the great British public to support what will, in fact rather than ideology, make us all better off financially and culturally.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/116800/9ade197d-293d-4e9d-9101-6a4dd1243160.png

Cornwall is my home and I cannot stand by and allow the destruction of this beautiful county without trying to do something about it.  There are many pressures on our county based on false narratives driven by corporations who value their profits above all other considerations.  We desperately need change and to make our county great again.

The Heritage Party is a party based on social conservatism. We as the living generation are responsible for looking after the heritage which has been passed to us from our forefathers, and we have a duty to pass it on to the generations which will come after us.    

Successive governments have eroded our freedom, given away our sovereignty and mismanaged our economy. The Heritage Party exists to return to the principles of social conservatism, to reverse the cultural destruction wrecked by politically correct ideologies and to return to our true traditions and heritage. In embracing these principles, we believe the United Kingdom can once again become a great and prosperous nation. 

I believe politicians forget that they are elected to serve the people.  This is something that I will not do.  To help me to keep to this commitment I need the constituents of North Cornwall to communicate with me regarding their concerns and worries. 

I am delighted to be standing for the Heritage Party in this election.

After completing my education at Wadebridge School, I pursued Art and Illustration at Falmouth University before transitioning into mental health and learning disabilities nursing for the NHS in Bodmin. Currently residing in Wadebridge, I am focused on encouraging my children to pursue higher education. My husband, originally from St. Austell, is a former rugby player, and we have changed careers over time to support our family.



I fled South Africa's apartheid regime and was raised by my single mother and experienced the transformations in Cornwall firsthand. Life was challenging in late seventies Britain and here again in twenty twenty-four, I find my family now living the same way. We managed by buying second-hand clothes and affordable cuts of meat from the local butcher. Living near my grandparents' dairy farm facilitated my mother's employment unfortunately childcare has been non-existent for us.



My political involvement started at Wadebridge Town Council and expanded to include participation in The Labour Party and Labour Women's Network. Over the years, I have received political education and partnered with Unions. Advocating for women on the issue of ""Violence at work is not part of the job"". Additionally, I harvested cabbages for food banks last year and undertook a fundraising walk in February this year for Refuge.



My key focuses in North Cornwall are:



1, Addressing the issue of affordable housing for both renting and purchasing.



2, Improving National Health services for all age groups.



3, Promoting green employment opportunities through training and sustainability.



I am dedicated to being a strong voice for North Cornwall to effectively represent my constituents in Westminster as an MP.

Chloe has been the Environment Chair at Stroud District Council since she was elected in 2021. With her help, the Council has introduced many key projects in support of nature and climate action, while maintaining and improving the core public services it provides.

More recently, Chloe was elected by the Conservative-led County Council to chair its Environment Scrutiny Committee, alongside her seats on the Audit, Overview & Scrutiny and Pensions Committees. These roles reflect Chloe’s reputation as a trusted pair of hands at both councils.

Which issues? For a start, lack of housing that really is affordable, profiteering water companies being allowed to pollute North Devon’s seas, finding green solutions which work for farming and improving the public transport system to reduce traffic jams.

But more than that, he’s interested to know what other people think the issues are and if they have any ideas about solving them.

So it’s an honour for me to have been chosen as the Liberal Democrat candidate for North Devon. I love this area and feel lucky to have brought up my family here after being posted to Chivenor by the RAF in 1989. I’m a bluff Yorkshireman who has made Barnstaple my home for the last 34 years, during which time I’ve served my community through work, local politics and fundraising.

I came here by chance but I’ve stayed here by choice.

I’m hoping to represent the people of North Devon in Westminster and to make their voices heard. Having worked in healthcare and housing, I understand the pressures that people face.

I have served the community in my charity work and in Barnstaple by being an elected councillor, at town, district and county level. I see North Devon is facing enormous challenges and we are currently being let down, due to the cost of living crisis, the lack of political action to protect our environment and the shortage of affordable housing and opportunities. We need better paid jobs and the right training for our young people.

According to a recent social mobility report from Exeter University, there is an absence of a strong political voice at the national level advocating on behalf of the region, unlike, for example, the Northern Powerhouse movement. Instead, politicians here believe things are “fine”. I want to challenge this and ensure that I am North Devon’s voice in Parliament and not Parliament’s voice in North Devon.

Housing is something I feel passionately about, and it’s one where the people of North Devon are being let down, victims of the rising market for second homes and holiday lets. Second homes have left some coastal villages such as Croyde, Mortehoe and Georgeham like ghost towns in the winter, but full to bursting in the summer.

I pledge a sincere commitment to serve the constituency of North Devon, the place my children were born and the area I love.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/64520-e3adee8b-de5a-4c3e-8890-ec7507d0a454.png

Having persuaded his Parish Council to declare a Climate and Ecological Emergency 4 years ago, he established a Climate Working Group which has successfully decarbonised the village hall by replacing the oil-fired heating system with air source heat pumps. In addition the hall has now been fitted with solar PV panels and battery storage, reducing the hall’s electricity cost and enabling the hall to earn an income from exporting electricity to the national grid.

If elected he says that his top priorities would be the development of a genuinely sustainable local economy with green jobs, affordable zero carbon housing, and taking full advantage of Dorset’s capacity for renewable energy generation.

He also considers that farming is the single most important occupation of all, but that it is not being appropriately supported. The changing climate is making farming increasingly difficult, both at home and abroad, and many modern farming practices contribute to the climate and ecological crisis, including the pollution of our watercourses. He points out that UK is also heavily dependent on food imports, and so we urgently need to increase our production of home-grown fruit and vegetables. Farmers also need to be adequately supported to enable them to adopt truly sustainable forms of farming, based on organic methods that do not use toxic chemicals.

As an MP Ken would campaign for a more cooperative and democratic form of government. This would include the reform of the electoral system to adopt proportional representation, and the use of Citizens Assemblies to make government decision making more democratic.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/30330.png

He has lived in the North Dorset area for most of his life and currently lives in Sturminster Newton. Several times he has left the area either for education or for work purposes abroad, including driving road trains in Australia. He feels that now is the time to enter the political sphere, unfortunately mostly due to anger.

He feels let down by 13 years of Labour's fiscal irresponsibility, followed by 14 years of absolute toxic Tory chaos and lies.... with nothing more than one big game of hot potato amongst its top brass in recent years to show for it!

How is it that any taxpayer can justify going to work to fund hotel rooms for people who have entered our country illegally? How has our country got 20 million people on the waiting list for our NHS? (Yes, its 20 million!) Not 7.7 million people as the Tories keep claiming! How have we allowed ourselves to fall into £2.5 trillion of national debt? Why has the economy been stagnant for the last 15 years? Why do we keep sending British taxpayers' money which we all have no say in to support foreign governments to fight other governments' proxy wars? Why is everyone being punished for having clean air?

Why do our elderly have to sell their house to fund social care? Where are the 40 new hospitals Britain was promised? Why is there so much rubbish on the sides of our roads? Why are our schools falling down onto our children from aerated concrete? Why are we not investing in our farmers to produce high yields of food production to stop importing expensive foreign food products? Why have we not invested in fibre optic broadband and other digital technologies?

Where is the online protection for children, families and young people against online harms? How can we bring communities together to share our sports, hobbies, clubs and societies? Why has Brexit not been done properly? Why do I need a visa to go on a slightly longer holiday or travel in Europe? Where is the incentive to invest in science, technology and engineering in our area? Why is Britain no longer ready to deploy its armed forces overnight abroad if it had to? What happened to helping our veterans who sleep rough at night having served for their country?

Where is the pride, discipline and respect amongst young people these days? What happened to national service? Why are we dumping sewage multiple times every day into our rivers and seas? Why does everyone's council tax keep rocketing? Why are our farmers not being valued 3 times a day and not being paid properly by the supermarkets?

Why are the pension systems not reformed to match those similar to European countries? Where have family values gone with lack of support for free childcare? Why is it impossible to freely trade and set up a new business without getting hammered for corporation tax and business rates? Where is the incentive to go and do an honest days' work? Why do young people have no hope of being able to afford their own home?

Why is the social housing waiting list currently sat at 1.6 million people? Why do people get stung with capital gains tax having worked hard their whole life for their cash and assets? Why do people not have spare cash or savings anymore? Why are we in a cost-of-living crisis? How can young people afford £9,250 per year to go to university?

Why have the roads not been re-surfaced with fresh tarmac? Why are people choosing over whether to heat their home or put hot food on the table? Why are my energy bills so expensive? Why are people relying on food banks? Where is the drive to upskill Britain and get more people trade qualified? Why are children being taught its acceptable to have a sex change under the age of 18?

Why do we have such social regional inequality across Britain? Why are transport links between our villages and towns so minimal? Where is the proper help that our vulnerable elderly and disabled so desperately need? Why has the education syllabus not been overhauled to teach our young essential life skills, e.g. cooking, driving, swimming, home economics etc.? Why have we not overhauled the welfare system with a simple 'Universal Basic Income' e.g. citizens wage?

Why do we not have proportional representation? Why do we not have multi-choice referendums allowing the people to decide what happens in our country, not our politicians? Why does it flood every year on cue everywhere in Britain? Where is the spirit to run a successful business and make money?

Why has Britain crumbled?

If you’re starting to get the gist of where I'm coming from with this and if you have had enough of all of the problems too, then perhaps now is the time to look at alternatives to the status quo when voting at this year’s general election....

We live in a democracy! We are free to think, act and speak freely meaning you don’t have to completely agree with everything that any one party is standing for, or for that case agree with anything that anyone says! I do have a vision myself of what the state should look like and how it should operate and be governed. I think we all do. So if you a bright idea and you feel very passionately about something, then make sure your voice is heard!

In a nutshell, we need to clear the debt. We need a new hospital building program. We need a new school building program. We need to scrap university and college tuition fees. We need to pay our medical staff properly and show them respect. We need to educate our young properly. We need to help people get their own house. We need energy security to bring prices down, perhaps with a new publicly owned nuclear energy company. We need food security to bring prices down and support our farmers. We need a road re-surfacing program and a motorist/trucking services re-building program, something I will personally absolutely fight for. We need a new pensions system, perhaps with private investment bonds with taxpayer money.

We need to stimulate the economy for decent public services with 15% corporation tax, scrapping business rates, all new businesses being  corporation tax free for the first 2 years, increase the personal tax free allowance from £12,570 to £20,000, change the PAYE tax bands perhaps from 20/40/45 to 15/30/45, move the goal posts for PAYE too putting more money in people's pocket, strip out as much unnecessary red tape as possible, perhaps cap council tax at £50/£100 per month and have a fiscal responsibility enquiry on a local level, bring back the £1,200 energy price cap, the possibility of food stamps for families, smash inflation to as close to 0% as possible helping ease the cost of living, interest rates, mortgages and people's real terms wages.

No immigration = no economy. Too much immigration = pressure on public services, housing and infrastructure. A sensible, legal and safe 1-in 1-out approach to migration policy will help get the economy up and running and keep the population at a fairly sensible level. A strong hard working upskilled productive workforce is what Britain needs! A strong economy needs certain levers to be pulled and it’s not an overnight thing! It takes time to build a healthy strong economy! And after a hard long weeks' work, what’s wrong with a beer and a smoke on your weekend off? I have no problem with it, but that's just my own personal opinion. Maybe we may need legislation for that too!

Whatever we need, we need change.... and we need it now! So, make sure you vote for it! Put on your British redcoat and have some pride! See you all in battle at the general election! Thank you and God bless the Westcountry!

It's the same story all around us with our other public services.

Ross first became involved in politics in February 2010 when he began working for South Normanton Parish Council at the age of 20 as part of an apprenticeship program by Bolsover District Council. In September 2012, South Normanton Parish Council offered Ross a promotion to become the Parish Clerk and Responsible Financial Officer, which put him in charge of the day to day running of that local authority administering a budget of over £300,000. Ross was one of the youngest Parish Clerks in the country at the time.

Since then Ross has been committed to local communities and embraced community cohesion to improve the local area.

In January 2016, Ross became the first Chair of newly created North East Derbyshire & Bolsover District Liberal Democrats and has been the driving force of the Liberal Democrats in our local area.

Ross believes that evidence based politics should determine the future; and that, more than anything, politics should be relevant to and shaped around the needs of people.

Since childhood I have held a firm appreciation of individual and the rights of citizens against The State. Having family members who lived under communist regimes and having lived in the authoritarian regimes of communist China and Putin’s Russia myself I believe we have still maintained some veneer of liberty in the UK. Sadly, in recent years that liberty has become increasingly under threat, not just from our politicians but from advances in surveillance technology and censorship of speech online. For me, the State’s hideous response to the Covid-19 pandemic finally removed any doubt about the dangers we face as a nation and the immediate need for action. This is why I have decided to stand as a candidate for the Libertarian Party. 

2020 will be remembered as the year the United Kingdom finally and decisively threw off any pretence of functioning as a healthy liberal democracy. Lockdown was the most egregious State assault on individual liberty since the suspension of Habeas Corpus.

Within the first weeks of the pandemic it was clear that the substantially lighter Swedish approach was the right one. A June 2020 trip to Stockholm unmasked a lost world in which people went about their daily business, breathing freely, uninhibited and alive. The Swedes did not give up their liberty to The State. Proportionately, far fewer of their nation lost their lives. Meanwhile, in the UK private individuals were forced to shutter their businesses while the taxpayer funded the economic inactivity of millions; loved ones were prevented from meeting -- even on their deathbeds; our children were denied an education, some locked in with their abusers. Lockdown did irreparable damage to our young people, and continues to manifest in mental health and behavioural issues, further compounding the recruitment and retainment crisis in education.  To add insult to injury in this dystopian nightmare, fearmongering and informing on our neighbours was encouraged by State propaganda through its taxpayer funded mouthpiece the BBC. All  the while our Prime Minister showed a flagrant disregard for his own rules. This was the United Kingdom in the 21st Century. It is worth remembering that MPs were eventually given a free vote on these heinous coronavirus measures in March 2021 and the vast majority voted to keep us imprisoned. This amounted to no less than treason against the sovereign individual. This would not have been possible with a written constitution upholding the rights of the individual against The State as proposed by the Libertarian Party. 

Government has been playing fast and loose not only with our rights but also with our hard-earned money. We currently face the highest tax burden since the conclusion of the Second World War while Rwanda have received £240 million for quite literally nothing as billions have been thrown at the galactic black hole that is HS2. All this against the backdrop of a state-manufactured inflation and cost of living crisis -– who could have possibly known that furlough and shutting down the economy for months would have repercussions later on?

Soon the British public will have to choose between a “Conservative” party, which has long since jettisoned any semblance of conservatism and the frightening prospect of fiscal responsibility lying with the Labour Party. The Liberal Democrats are still in love with Brussels, the Greens would make environmental totalitarianism the State religion and one only needs to read the views of Reform UK’s prospective candidates to see their thinly-veiled admiration for hard-right authoritarianism and demagogues abroad. The Libertarian Party offers the only alternative based on the rights of the individual against an increasingly bloated state. I am honoured to stand as a libertarian candidate during these uncertain times.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/38153/49aaf3d1-046c-4359-856b-8bf055f84b1e.png

The new NESH constituency is positioned in an area of Lib Dem strength. In last May’s local elections, the Lib Dems romped home in North East Somerset, inflicting a bruising defeat upon the Conservatives.

The Liberal Democrats are a strong force in local government within the NESH area. Of the councillors in the wards located within NESH (the constituency has wards from both the South Gloucestershire and BANES authorities), 12 are Lib Dem and 9 are Conservative. Labour and the Green Party only have 4 and 1 councillor respectively.

Dine Romero has been a BANES councillor since 2003. In her time in office, she has served in a number of important roles and led the local authority through the Covid pandemic.

Most recently, as chair of the council’s Children, Adults, Health and Wellbeing policy development and scrutiny panel, Dine has launched an initiative to explore how BANES council and other bodies can do more to tackle knife crime among young people - an issue that has come to the fore after a number of recent and tragic incidents in both Bath and Bristol.

In addition to tackling knife crime and anti-social behaviour, Dine’s priorities are:

1. Improved access to NHS and social care services. Across the constituency, people are suffering from unacceptable wait times for GP appointments, emergency ambulances, referrals and treatments. Dine is calling for improved access to NHS dentistry after nearby Bristol made the national press with images of long queues of people seeking to register with an NHS dentist.

2. Tackling the cost of living crisis. Dine knows that people across the constituency are struggling with energy bills, food prices, soaring mortgages and rents. Dine wants the government to do more to help people, especially in rural areas where the effect of the crisis is often more keenly felt.

3. Campaigning for better local bus services. Local residents have been let down by Labour’s WECA Mayor Dan Norris, who has squandered money on vanity projects rather than essential bus services. Dine will campaign to get services that have been cut or reduced, running again.

Commenting on her selection, Cllr Dine Romero said:

“I’m thrilled to be selected as the Lib Dem candidate for the North East Somerset and Hanham constituency. I want to build on recent Lib Dem successes in the area.

“Unlike other parties, the Lib Dems work hard and keep in touch all year round. We take the time to listen to people’s concerns and be their voice. That approach is recognised and appreciated by local people and explains why the Lib Dems performed so well in last year’s local elections.

“For over 20 years I’ve been a voice for local people at the BANES council - and now I have an opportunity to be a voice for us in parliament.”

This part of Somerset will see significant parliamentary boundary changes. The new NESH constituency will differ radically from the current North East Somerset seat. Only half of the existing seat will remain in the new one; Bathavon North moves to the Bath constituency and Radstock and Midsomer Norton joins the new Frome and East Somerset constituency. The Bristol suburb of Hanham in South Gloucestershire also becomes part of NESH.

Dine will be standing against high-profile Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. The Conservatives’ bruising defeat in local elections last year was even felt in Jacob Rees-Mogg’s home ward of Mendip, where the Lib Dems won a massive 75% of the vote whilst the Conservatives only managed 16%.

The Labour party has yet to announce a candidate for the NESH constituency and in a leaked internal party document, Labour described the constituency as one of its “non-battleground” seats.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/50024.png

The UK is a democracy, and we must respect the result.
As Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats failed to back our timetable to leave the EU on 31 October, we now face further uncertainty.
Jeremy Corbyn would like to force a second referendum on the British people, having ignored the first – meaning pointless delay and indecision.
The Liberal Democrats want to ignore the June 2016 Referendum, which is neither liberal nor democratic.
I also do not see an advantage in voting for the Brexit party as this will split the leave vote, leading to more remainer seats as we recently saw in Brecon and Radnorshire. Their other policies are not yet clear from the Brexit party.
The Conservatives just produced the Queens speech which sets out a detailed plan for the NHS, Environment, Economy and a strong domestic agenda.

My approach to Brexit

The best way to end Brexit is therefore to leave and do so in an orderly way with the deal that Boris negotiated with the EU. It is good for us and good for the EU. They are our neighbours and we should accept the deal.
I voted for Boris’ deal as it is better without the backstop.
I therefore once again support a General Election so that those of us who, like me, respect the referendum result can get a majority in Parliament to get us out of the EU.

Why your vote matters

I also respect those who have different views on this. Yet I would like to ask you to consider the point that this General election is not just a protest about the referendum result.
Brexit will play an integral role in the election, but it is about so much more. What is now at stake is who leads either Boris or Jeremy Corbyn.
The choice is yours between a country driven by compassionate conservatism and strong economic growth or by a misguided Marxism that would wreck our economy and put hard-earned jobs at risk again. Just as we are recovering!

The risk of a Labour Government or Labour-led coalition is real, and that is why I am asking you to vote for me.

My plan for North Herefordshire

This election is an opportunity to deliver for North Herefordshire so that we can benefit from:

Fairer funding for schools. £14bn extra funding announced by the Government this autumn will help children in North Herefordshire receive the education they deserve.
Raising broadband standards. I will continue to work to rollout fibre broadband and improve the service.
Securing more funding for our roads. The Government have designated £1,252,647 to Herefordshire roads since 2017, and I will secure further funding as rural communities should have the same quality of road as our towns.
Improving our public transport services by building on the Government’s new National Bus Strategy and continuing to campaign for a better rail network.
More police to keep North Herefordshire safe. I look forward to working with the new officers posted to Herefordshire as part of the Government’s £750m project to strengthen police numbers.
Supporting our farmers and producers as we transition to a new Agricultural Policy.
 
Thank you to all those who have been in touch. I look forward to meeting many more North Herefordshire residents in the weeks to come and I hope I can count on your support on December 12th.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/553c9ef941b868785b1fe67f.png

“I’m delighted that we will have the opportunity to put forward the positive Liberal Democrat vision for the country. We will guarantee people the right to see their GP, and end the 8am rush. 

“We’re going to ensure people receive timely treatment for cancer, and ensure investment in research to bring about new tests and treatments for some of the toughest cancers. 

“We’re going to recruit more dentists, fix the NHS dentistry crisis and stop North Norfolk being a dental desert.

“North Norfolk deserves an MP with the courage of their convictions, who will speak up for them and vote in their interests, not simply follow the party line. We need a strong voice to bring about a new kind of politics.

After a decades long career as a graphic designer in London I was delighted to return to my home county. Happisburgh has now been my home for nearly 24 years, a place where the consequences of climate change are all too immediate and personal. Erosion is wreaking havoc on Norfolk’s coastal communities, with disrupted rainfall patterns, sea-level rise, and winter storm surges all accelerating an already familiar process. My love for Norfolk, therefore, very much extends to a love for our planet.

Other communities around the globe similarly threatened have found natural solutions to halt or slow the disappearance of their villages into the sea. Sandscaping, a Dutch technique wherein sand is pumped to widen and lengthen beaches, thereby increasing land mass to protect against storm surges, has been trialled at Bacton. I would love to see this happen elsewhere in Norfolk, not only protecting our critical infrastructure, but our equally important, truly unique, and irreplaceable communities.

Everyone in the constituency lives within a mile or two of a farm. What happens on them affects us all. Conventional farming has been heavily criticised, causing biodiversity loss, soil erosion, and increased water pollution, all through rampant usage of synthetic fertilisers and agrochemicals. Some impressive local examples of farmers working with nature to prevent, mitigate, and reverse these impacts do exist, improving soil health and water quality, as well as increasing pollinator numbers. I would love to see all farmers recognise these benefits, committing themselves to ecological, nature-friendly, regenerative and organic methods.

Decent public transport has a vital role in reducing carbon emissions and thereby averting the climate crisis. It’s bad luck, then, that it is woefully inadequate, or often next to non-existent, in North Norfolk. Reducing emissions means leaving your car at home, or removing the need for one altogether. For this, access to reliable, frequent, and affordable bus and train services is crucial. Lack of public transport also makes it near-impossible for those who don’t have, can’t afford, or cannot drive, a car to get to work or access public services. Walking or cycling to see the GP simply isn’t an option for North Norfolk’s largely elderly, and rural, population.

Warm homes are another issue dear to me. We have wasted years of potential progress in insulating homes and demanding new-builds meet higher standards. Heat pumps and external wall insulation, if fitted five years ago, would now have saved householders hundreds of pounds off bills every year, and moving us towards being self sufficient in energy production. It is clearer than ever that sound climate policy is sound economic policy.

Urgent action is needed to address the climate crisis locally, nationally, and internationally. All organisations need a Green or two in the room, not just for environmental justice, but for social justice. I would be honoured to represent our beautiful constituency of North Norfolk, ensuring that very beauty remains for years to come.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/57609/943b78d5-f93c-40ab-8e08-c74e982731e1.png

That means good schools for all our children, access to vital health and social care when we need it, better training and apprenticeships, investment in green energy and food production, a healthy and stable economy creating good jobs and opportunities for business, an end to water companies polluting our rivers with sewage, public transport back under public control delivering vital routes for our rural communities and a government that is on your side working for everyone not one that leaves you feeling less safe or struggling to make ends meet and worried about the future.



As a Wimbledon Tennis Umpire I was used to making the right calls under pressure, as a solicitor I work hard to deliver the best for my clients and uphold the highest standards, as a charity manager I delivered vital funding to those who needed it most, as a local councillor I stand up for local people and fight for local services.



I am meeting thousands of local people and listening to your concerns so that I can deliver what matters to you after the next General Election. North Warwickshire and Bedworth deserves an MP that is visible, hard working and who can bring national experience and local knowledge to secure the future we need. I am ready for the challenge and I will work hard for you.

Whether living in the most rural parts of North West Cambridgeshire, or in our towns, or in the southern half of Peterborough - people of all ages across our constituency are witnessing a continual decline in public services. GP appointments are impossible to access, local bus services continue to be cut, and there is a desperate lack of affordable housing across our area -- from Ramsey to Wittering and everywhere in between.



Only a Labour government can deliver the change that North West Cambridgeshire needs. I will stand up for our communities, and I am delighted to advocate for a Labour government to restore hope and opportunity across our area.



My background is in biomedical research, and I strongly believe that we need more scientists in Parliament - as well as more young people with real-world experience of the issues that our country is grappling with. I also have experience as a district councillor, where I am working to protect and enhance local government services despite the precarious financial circumstances the government has left councils in across Britain. I'm an experienced representative with a record of delivery, and I hope to gain the trust of North West Cambridgeshire's residents to deliver real change for our communities.

We need an MP who genuinely cares for, and stands up for the constituency; who fights for our NHS; who protects our environment and cleans up our rivers; who tackles rising food prices and energy bills; and who ensures we have the infrastructure we need for our growing communities.

Local residents deserve an MP who listens to them, who understands their concerns and priorities and who will be their voice in Parliament. 

Why can I win?

Right now, voters across the country are turning away from the Conservatives in their droves and only the Liberal Democrats can beat them in North West Essex.

After coming second here in the last General Election, we have gone from strength to strength. We have gained 4 new councillors across the constituency in both Uttlesford and Chelmsford City Councils, while Labour has no councillors in the whole constituency.

Having spoken to a number of local voters in the constituency since the start of the year, we know that the Conservative vote is collapsing, and people are ready to put their trust in the Lib Dems.

More about me

I have lived on the border of the constituency in Chelmsford since 2010, where I live with my husband and two children. North West Essex is a beautiful, well-connected and diverse part of the country and I am privileged to have the opportunity to represent such a wonderful area.

Professionally, I have worked in recruitment and training but have spent the last fifteen years serving the community through a variety of endeavours. At present, I am a Chelmsford City Councillor, a school Governor, a University Associate Chaplain and a charity trustee. I pledge to bring much needed trust and integrity back into politics.

Grant remarried in July 2022 and now lives with his wife Jennifer and their cockapoo, Candice.

After leaving grammar school in 1969, Grant briefly worked for United Glass before enlisting in the Royal Air Force in the ATC Branch.  After leaving the Air Force, Grant went into sales and formed his own limited company.  He became active with the Conservative Party and became Chairman of Saffron Walden Constituency Conservative Association Town Branch, as well as serving four years as a town councillor.

In 2005, Grant moved to Turkey but had to move back to the UK in 2019 for health reasons.  Grant decided to once more get involved in politics when he saw the direction the country was taking under the Conservative Government and decided to join Reform UK in early 2023.

Grant is now determined to spread the Reform UK word and let people know that there is an alternative to the binary political system that we currently have.  He is currently building a team of volunteers to help with fundraising and intends to introduce himself to as many constituents as he can over the next few months. 

Grant has witnessed the disaster first hand of R4U policies in Saffron Walden and the destruction of many green spaces for housebuilding on a massive scale but with little or no improvements in infrastructure.  There are not enough schools, doctor’s surgeries or dentists and the town gets gridlocked on a regular basis due to the unsustainable development still taking place.

Grant feels that he will better be able to serve North West Essex Constituency because he lives in and understands Saffron Walden and can travel to other parts of the Constituency easily and quickly.

“Reform UK are the only political party that hold the values that are dear to me, particularly those concerning immigration, Brexit, the gradual erosion of our democracy and freedom of speech, not to mention the appalling state of our utilities.”

You know, as well as I do, the challenges we face across North West Hampshire after 14 years of Conservative government. Our High Streets are emptying, our NHS is crumbling, our schools need improving, our neighbourhoods need proper policing, our Armed Forces need support and our rural communities have been cut off with buses slashed, libraries closed and banks disappearing.

A Labour Government led by Keir Starmer will transform our country and our communities. As your local MP, I will fight for our beautiful area to make sure we get the support we need to thrive once more.



We can see local police in our neighbourhoods again and schools that are thriving so every child is given the opportunity to succeed. We can see our NHS given the doctors, nurses and equipment it needs through a new NHS workforce plan and an expansion of new technology to diagnose and treat people more quickly. We can see Andover's High Street renewed and our small businesses supported by scrapping business rates and bringing in a fairer system. We can see Whitchurch and Overton have sustainable development with housing for the next generation alongside infrastructure support. We can see jobs in Tadley protected as we continue to support our Nuclear Deterrent. Across our beautiful villages, we can see rural crime tackled, the opportunity for new bus routes, banking hubs so we no longer have banking deserts.



We can get our future back, but only if you vote for it. Only I can beat the Tories in North West Hampshire.

Those of us who've planted trees may have felt their input was insignificant, but when you step back and see the effect of so many being involved - it's awesome!

    But what if this were only the first step?

    What if we became a beacon of the future for the whole of the UK?

    What if we nurture friendlier communities, green spaces, better tourism, healthier businesses?

    A real jewel in the crown - right in the heart of England.
    This is something we can all be part of, contribute to, and benefit from.

    A lifestyle full of opportunities, living in harmony with the natural world.

    What if we turn North West Leicestershire Green?""

I grew up in one of the county's small villages and went to the local comprehensive school. Norwich is my home and I know what a brilliant place it is. But our community has been let down, just as the country has.

I've been lucky enough to have a good state education, a good job and good health. Everyone deserves those things in a prosperous society. This isn't the reality in Norwich North under the Tories. Many people simply don't feel better off after over a decade of Conservative Government.

Throughout my life I've stood up for hope -- for fairness, for dignity, for equality. I've spent most of my career in the charity sector where I've campaigned for children's rights, against hunger, poverty and inequality. Wherever, I've lived I've been active in my community -- I've been a Labour councillor, a school governor, a Hospital Trust governor and during Covid I volunteered at a food bank delivering parcels.

Since becoming your candidate, I've spoken to thousands of you, listening to your experience under this Government and the change you want to see. With people right across our area, I've already fought to save our NHS walk-in centre, shone a spotlight on the state of our buses and backed our local businesses.

I will always be on your side. I want to use my skills, and experience to restore trust, hope and opportunity for everyone in Norwich North.

If you live in Norwich North and have any questions or thoughts please do get in touch.

He has been a member of the Licensing Committee since first elected, instrumental in developing the Stakeholders' Forum, a Green Party initiative with the aim of improving the late-night economy. Having completed a local investigation and reporting his findings to the Government Minister for Licensing at Westminster, he led Norwich City Council’s introduction of a Cumulative Impact Policy, which capped the number of bars in the Late Night Activity Zone. 

Ben has been involved with a number of community initiatives. Where drug dealing and prostitution were a major problem, he helped residents work with the council and the police to make a run-down park known as Old Library Wood, into a safe and friendly community space. He organised a river tidy on the River Wensum, removing rubbish and helping to highlight plastic pollution and the importance of the waterway. He worked with Thorpe Hamlet residents to build a successful campaign to oppose the proposed construction of a straw-burning incinerator power station known as Generation Park.  

He now chairs the Safer Neighbourhood Action Panel (SNAP) for the city centre and Thorpe Hamlet; this is a liaison meeting between local people and the community policing team, that sets the police’s quarterly neighbourhood priorities. Its aim is to reduce anti-social behaviour, drug dealing and prostitution in the city. 

At City Hall, Ben chairs the Audit committee, monitoring the way the council carries out its business. Here he has focused on governance, transparency and risk management, challenging the Labouur administration on its investment strategy, introducing training for members of the committee to improve overall performance and directing investigations into the governance of the council’s commercial company through the work of the internal audit team. 

As Vice Chair of the Mousehold Conservators, Ben’s spent the last two years working alongside council officers on the newly-agreed ten-year vision for Mousehold Heath, helping to create a focus on biodiversity and community participation. 

Ben has raised a number of issues at council level, including the introduction of council-owned electric car charging points in St Giles Car park to be made available for public use; road infrastructure improvements, to improve air quality along the ring road and outside of schools in his Thorpe Hamlet ward; better enforcement of idling vehicles; supporting biodiversity through calling for the reinstatement of the tree planting budget and challenging shrub removals. He has also repeatedly demanded 20Mph speed restrictions around the schools and residential roads across Thorpe Hamlet. 

A Gardener by profession and qualified Master Composter, he lives with his wife and their two children within the old city walls. A keen cyclist, he enjoys kayaking on the Wensum and attending football matches.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/17559.png

We’re a city that’s proud of standing out and doing things differently. While Norfolk is a sea of blue, we don’t have a single Tory councillor in Norwich. While the country voted to leave the EU, Norwich South voted 60:40 to remain. But above all, we’re a live-and-let-live city that’s united by our sense of fairness and which truly values all of our public services -  from our NHS through our fantastic local Police and Fire Service to the many hundreds of wonderful staff who care for our city’s older people.

As your MP I’ve taken action for Norwich on all of these issues and many more. I’ve opposed this government’s ruinous, self serving and ideological cuts to our local health service and social care system. I’ve stood up for our city’s parents and pupils as Tory school funding plans hit our schools far harder than anywhere else in East Anglia. Theresa May’s obsession with Brexit at all costs will hit Norwich hard, so I took a principled stand for our city against it in Parliament which meant I had to resign from my role as Shadow Secretary for Business. 

And because I know that so many in our city are working hard and still struggling to make ends meet, I am donating almost all of my MP’s 10% payrise to local charities.

But unless you support me and Labour at the General Election, we could easily end up with a Tory MP who won’t stand up for our city against national government and whose doesn’t share the values of the vast majority of people in this city.  Opinion polling of Norwich South done a couple of months ago showed that the Tories are only 8% behind Labour - with other parties already out of the race and unable to keep the Tories out. Only a vote for me and Labour can keep the Tories out in Norwich South.

Please support me at the General Election on June 8th so I can do even more to stand up for Norwich.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/4396/1c78e065-2846-4d99-bf8a-ba5e23b91a71.png

I am  a competent and experienced member of a Higher Education teaching team at a local college in Nottingham  bringing a wealth of expertise from my past roles in social and community work and as a PROFESSIONALLY trained social worker. I am dedicated to developing my practice and I am always sharing future research and innovative ideas with staff and students alike.  I work hard to support all my students giving them extra time for tutorials and study activities to ensure they are given every opportunity to achieve.  Alongside teaching level 4 and 5 students on our HNC/D I also adapt my teaching to support from level 1 right through to our Access to Higher Education courses. Our courses attract POLAR Quintile 1 and 2 and most of our students are a 1, this means we are working with highly challenging and deprived HE learners who are unlikely to achieve, but I ensure that I give them everything they need to achieve.  Nottingham is the 11th most deprived Local Authority District (out of 317) and I continuously provide oopportunities for those often excluded from higher education and this is a key driver for social mobility (Nottingham is a social mobility cold spot).  My entry into politics has been a long time coming and finally I have made a decision to follow this through. I am aware of both local issues and national social issues that need to be managed and competently overcome and I have with some diligence and intensity have come to some realisation that the following certainly need to be addressed in some shape, one way or the other, if GB is to become great once again. 1.	Financial Stability: Nottingham City Council faces significant financial challenges, highlighted by a Section 114 report indicating an inability to deliver a balanced budget for the year. This financial instability stems from increased demands for social care, rising homelessness, and inflation impacts. The council's forecasted gross General Fund pressure of £57 million, reduced to a net pressure of £23 million through management actions, underscores the urgent need for fiscal reforms and improved financial governance (My Nottingham News). 2.	Cost of Living and Social Care: The cost-of-living crisis is a pressing issue, with many households in Nottingham struggling to cope with rising expenses. This situation is compounded by increased demand for children's and adults' social care services, putting additional pressure on local resources and necessitating targeted interventions to support vulnerable populations (Notts TV). 3.	Housing and Homelessness: There is a significant issue with rising homelessness in Nottingham, driven by economic pressures and inadequate housing supply. Efforts to address this include calls for more national support and local initiatives to improve housing availability and affordability (My Nottingham News). 4.	Infrastructure and Development: The upcoming election for the first Mayor of the East Midlands Combined County Authority will have a major impact on planning, housing, roads, and economic development in the region. The new council governing 2.2 million people is expected to bring significant investments, such as the £1.2 billion devolution deal (Notts TV). 5.	Environmental Concerns: Nottingham is also focused on addressing environmental issues, being recognized as a leader in climate action. Efforts to achieve net-zero emissions and improve air quality are critical components of the city's agenda, reflecting a broader commitment to sustainable urban development (Centre for Cities).

Multicultural communities in Nottingham face several significant issues that any prospective politician should be aware of. These include: 1.	Deprivation and Poverty: Nottingham ranks high in deprivation, which disproportionately affects multicultural communities. This includes challenges related to housing, income, education, and healthcare. Many neighbourhoods in Nottingham are among the most deprived in England, exacerbating issues like low educational attainment and poor health outcomes (Nottingham Insight). 2.	Health Disparities: Mental health services often fail to adequately meet the needs of minority ethnic communities. There is a significant need for culturally appropriate and responsive mental health services to address these gaps (Race Equality Foundation). Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an unequal impact, worsening physical and mental health in already vulnerable populations (The Nottinghamshire Plan). 3.	Economic Inequality: Economic challenges are more acute in some areas of Nottinghamshire, with parts of the county lagging behind the national average in terms of education, skills, and earnings (The Nottinghamshire Plan). This economic disparity is felt more acutely in multicultural communities, where opportunities for upward mobility can be limited. 4.	Educational Disparities: Education is a critical issue, with significant skill gaps in various parts of Nottinghamshire. The pandemic has further impacted education, particularly in disadvantaged communities, making it harder to recover lost learning and affecting long-term life chances for children (The Nottinghamshire Plan). 5.	Council Financial Strain: Nottingham City Council is facing a significant budget shortfall, impacting its ability to provide services. This financial strain affects all residents but can disproportionately impact multicultural communities who rely more heavily on public services (My Nottingham News). Addressing these issues requires targeted policies that focus on reducing deprivation, improving access to culturally sensitive healthcare, supporting educational attainment, and ensuring economic opportunities are available to all community members. Engaging with community leaders and members to understand their specific needs and challenges is also crucial for creating effective and inclusive solutions.

Nottingham faces several crime and disorder issues that are significant for any prospective politician to address including, 1.	Violent Crime and Anti-Social Behaviour: Nottingham has experienced concerns related to violent crime and anti-social behaviour.  2.	Substance Misuse: Drug and alcohol misuse are persistent issues impacting community safety.  3.	Domestic Violence: Addressing domestic violence is a critical priority.  4.	Youth Crime: Engaging young people in positive activities to divert them from criminal activities is another focus.  5.	Community Safety Partnerships: Collaboration between Nottingham City Council, Nottinghamshire Police, and other local organisations is key to tackling crime. 

National Contemporary Social Issues 1.	Cost of Living Crisis: Nationally, the UK is grappling with a cost-of-living crisis, characterised by rising prices of essentials like food, energy, and housing.  2.	Healthcare and Social Care: The National Health Service (NHS) and social care sectors are under significant strain due to funding challenges, workforce shortages, and increasing demand.  3.	Housing Affordability and Homelessness: Housing remains a critical issue, with a shortage of affordable homes contributing to rising homelessness rates.  4.	Environmental Sustainability: Climate change and environmental sustainability are major national concerns. emissions by 2050, requiring substantial changes in energy production, transportation, and industrial practices. 5.	Economic Stability and Employment: Economic stability and employment are central to national discourse, with ongoing efforts to recover from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic

Current global issues significantly impacting UK politics include geopolitical tensions, economic challenges, climate change, and technological advancements. Here are some key points: 1.	Geopolitical Tensions:  US Presidential Election: The upcoming US presidential election in November 2024 is crucial, with potential implications for UK foreign policy.  •	Russia's Political Climate: The re-election of Vladimir Putin in March 2024 continues to solidify his control, likely continuing the aggressive stance in Ukraine.  2.	Economic Challenges:  Inflation and Interest Rates: Although inflation is expected to slow and interest rates may decrease gradually, the UK faces challenges in achieving significant economic growth.  •	Public Finances: The dire state of UK public finances limits the scope for increased public spending.  3.	Climate Change:   The UK's commitment to climate change initiatives remains a pressing issue.  4.	Technological Advancements:  Artificial Intelligence (AI): The rise of AI presents both opportunities and challenges for the UK.  5.	Global Role and Foreign Policy:  The UK's role on the global stage is under scrutiny. Improving relations with the EU post-Brexit, managing ties with the US and China, and contributing to international governance and development are critical areas for the next government.  The ongoing conflict in Gaza has significantly impacted UK politics, influencing both domestic and international policy stances and voter behaviour. Domestic Political Impact 1.	Labour Party Dynamics - Labour has experienced internal and external challenges due to its stance on the Gaza conflict. Leader Keir Starmer’s support for Israel has alienated some Muslim voters and party members, contributing to losses in local elections.   The issue has also led to defections within the party, with councillors leaving Labour due to perceived insufficient condemnation of Israel’s actions.  2.	Conservative Party Reactions - The Conservatives have maintained a more supportive stance towards Israel, aligning with the government's broader foreign policy.  3.	Public Opinion and Activism - The conflict has sparked significant public demonstrations and activism across the UK. Protests in support of both Palestinians and Israelis have been frequent, sometimes leading to tensions and requiring increased security measures.  International and Diplomatic Impact 1.	Foreign Policy Stance:  The UK's position on the Gaza conflict is part of its broader foreign policy, aiming to balance support for Israel with calls for humanitarian relief in Gaza.  2.	Transatlantic Relations:  The conflict also plays into the UK's relationship with the United States. The Biden administration's strong support for Israel has influenced UK policy, as both nations often coordinate on Middle Eastern policy matters.  3.	Global Political Repercussions:  The Gaza conflict has broader implications for global politics, influencing electoral dynamics and political discourse in countries with significant Muslim populations or strong pro-Israel constituencies.  The Gaza conflict continues to shape UK politics, affecting party dynamics, voter behaviour, and the country's foreign policy. As the situation evolves, its repercussions will likely remain a significant factor in both domestic and international political arenas.

After 14 years of decline under the Tories, it’s time for change – in Bexley and across Britain.

I live locally in South East London and have grown and spent most of my life in outer London.  I know the challenges that residents here face, from the cost of living, crime and anti-social behaviour, to accessing NHS services when you need them and an education system that improves life chances for local children.  Residents struggle with the cost of living after the Tories crashed the economy, leaving families to pay the price.   Families across Britain are being hit hard by a mortgage and housing bombshell, costing homeowners and renters hundreds extra each month.  With food and energy prices so high, this is the last thing families need.  Labour will take tough decisions to restore economic stability.

I am proud to work for the NHS, but I see how it’s been let down by a decade of Tory decline.  Despite the hard work of NHS staff, after 13 years of Tory neglect, our health and care system is too often not there when it’s needed.  The longer the Conservatives are in power, the longer patients from Bexley, Sidcup, Blackfen, Welling and Falconwood will wait for care.

I will work tirelessly to support greater community care, improve outcomes for patients and help cut NHS waiting times. Labour’s saved the NHS before and we’ll do it again.

As the first in my family to go to university, I was lucky to benefit from the expansion of university education that Labour delivered in government, but today I meet so many local people who tell me they don’t think their children will have the same opportunities they had.  If elected, I’ll help deliver Labour’s pledge to recruit 6,500 new teachers and to improve childcare to make sure that all of our children get the best possible start in life.

I’m asking residents in Old Bexley and Sidcup for your support and your vote on Thursday 4th July so we can have a Labour government which will lead a decade of renewal.

My award winning Be Fair - Pay on Time campaign started as a local issue but became a national campaign. Recommendations from my parliamentary inquiry were incorporated into 2014 Small Business Act and late payments to small businesses have fallen from £41.5bn in 2014 to £14bn now.

With over 2,000 people across the constituency living with dementia, my Dementia Friendly Oldham campaign has created over 8,500 Dementia Friends. I will continue to fight for the rights of disabled people, including those with dementia, influencing attitudes and changing practices.

Since 2014 my annual summer school has brought scores of young people from across Oldham borough together, to empower them, and to raise their awareness about what politics is all about: public service.

I will continue to fight for improved access at Greenfield station, reliable and affordable bus services and forfunding to fix our brownfield sites, so we always build on brownfield sites first, tackling the housing shortage while protecting our green spaces.

During this time, I had the privilege of employing staff and providing essential services to businesses and educational institutions. Additionally, I dabbled in small-scale commercial real estate ventures.

While I have not been deeply involved in politics in the past, recent years have highlighted to me the systemic flaws within our political system. It has become increasingly evident that our current political landscape no longer accurately represents the average working person of our nation. A significant portion of the political elite seems disconnected from the everyday realities faced by the majority, often making decisions that do not align with the desires of the electorate. This status quo urgently demands change.

I firmly believe that Members of Parliament are elected to serve their constituents and hold the government accountable. However, this fundamental principle appears to have been lost amidst the current political climate. It is my steadfast belief that the only political party capable of restoring Great Britain to a true democracy is Reform UK.",

My mum is a carer and my dad is a prison officer.

I've faced many of the same struggles that people across our area face daily - and I've used these experiences to fight for what is best for people locally throughout my career.

Unlike many in politics, I didn't take the typical path through university. I haven't got a degree and I haven't spent a lot of time in the Halls of Westminster.

Instead, my career began locally. I got my first job aged 13. My first proper job was at River Island in the Ridings in Wakefield, when I was 16 - and then as a Community Development Officer working with local kids at Wakefield Trinity, where I secured funding to improve local children's health and wellbeing, and giving 2,000 young people the chance to engage with sport.

Now, in my professional life, I work to support vital local and national campaigns, like holding water companies to account when they pollute our rivers and seas, calling for support through the cost of living crisis and tackling NHS waiting lists.

These are all key issues facing us across Ossett and Denby Dale.

In the last four years, Labour has changed. And whilst we've changed for the better, the Conservatives have changed Britain for the worse.

We all know the damage that the Conservatives have done over the last 13 years. And we all know that we can't afford any more.

​That's why I am standing - because I believe we deserve better. Because it's time for change. Because we deserve a fresh start.

I want every child to grow up in a world with freedom, true democracy and absolute human rights where politicians and leaders operate with integrity for the future of our society and our economy. Our governments have not been acting in our best interest. The impact of lockdown and damaging or immoral policy making have been devastating to our individual lives; our health, society and economy have not been their priority.

Opposition parties have not been standing against damaging decisions and policies and we the people are now morally obliged to be the opposition. Without political intervention our country will continue to be led by individuals with conflicts of interest or ulterior motives.

I recognise that it’s impossible to go back to the way it used to be, this does not mean that we have to accept the ‘New Normal’ as it’s laid out to us by those who have taken absolute control. We have the ultimate opportunity for change if that’s what we want, to create a fair and just world. We can of course, choose to live in fear and hang on to the idea of the return to the ‘Old Normal’ or we can choose to create our own future, a new future that works for us, our children and our children’s children.

The last few years in the NHS and Social Care have been a failure of Government. Quite simply our citizens have found the NHS has not been there for them when they needed it most. This is not the fault of NHS workers but a choice by the Conservatives not to plan our services and staffing properly. It has been heartbreaking watching patients waiting in the Emergency Department for hours and even days. Patients face huge barriers in accessing care, be it difficulties seeing their GP or long waiting lists. This is a failure that this government should be ashamed of. A vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to save our NHS after years of Conservative chaos. One issue that has been raised time and again by the people of Pendle and Clitheroe on the doorsteps is the horrifying conflict in the Middle East and the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza. Anna says “I have spoken to many people about this conflict, and the unimaginable horror facing civilians.

As the daughter of a Palestinian she has faced the trauma of supporting her family escape yet has spoken insightfully to understand both peoples.

Having voted Green in 2015, I was a Labour member during Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership but returned to the Greens as the only party that truly reflects my beliefs of fairness, social equity, and environmental protection. I have been actively engaged in campaigning to elect Green councillors in the neighbouring Hillsborough ward in 2022, 2023 and 2024. 

As a teacher and contractor in Countryside Management, I understand the value that nature brings to people. We should all be proud of the incredible green and blue spaces in our constituency such as the River Don, parts of the Peak District, and a wealth of reservoirs. A key aim is to improve community access to these, especially for those who don’t drive, who can be the most isolated in any community. I would fully utilise schemes such as the Green Infrastructure Framework to reinvigorate and reconnect fragmented habitats.

Too often, agriculture is viewed as opposed to nature and farmers need winning round to the Green Party. I see the value that local farmers bring to the area and would work with them to cultivate nature without cutting income. I want to see closer ties between the agricultural community and environmental groups and have the understanding and experience to make this happen.

We must campaign to halt the downward spiral of service cuts and price hikes which simply lead to fewer customers and further cuts. Bus services are vital in rural communities, and these essential public services must be taken back under public control. We need to increase the frequency of bus services within the constituency, to Sheffield, Barnsley, and the Peak District.

I support the campaign to re-open the Don Valley Railway to deliver Stocksbridge residents to Sheffield quickly and regularly, alongside the Upper Don Trail for an ‘active travel’ route. These projects would remove cars from our roads, improving safety and air quality; bringing innumerable benefits to the health, well-being, economy and happiness of our population.

I believe local decisions should be taken by local people; I would push for more powers to local councils and regions, and would work closely with the Sheffield City Region mayor to further increase the devolution of powers. I hope never again to see the sheer arrogance that led to Sheffield’s tree-felling scandal.

Thankfully we now have a greater chance of eradicating this thinking after the successful citywide referendum delivering a new governance system in Sheffield City Council with 14 Green councillors working hard towards these aims. Similarly, I support efforts to investigate decision-making and spending within the £24 million Stocksbridge Town Deal to improve transparency and accountability.

As the Green candidate for Penistone and Stocksbridge, I pledge to focus on bringing nature into the heart of our community, improving ties within the community, and delivering better public transport and increased devolution of powers.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/116712/bac5d8d0-749d-4b0b-99c3-45d304aacdfc.png

These varied experiences have given me a broad view of the needs of Scottish people and has led me to want to work for improved lives and communities locally.

Why I am standing as the Reform Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Perth and Kinross-shire

I have lived in beautiful rural Perthshire for twenty years and I’m well aware of the challenges in rural areas. In recent years, we’ve seen the loss of post offices and police stations, poor public transport, and a drastic need for housing and jobs to help young people remain in the area. Perth city centre needs regeneration and Reform’s small business policies would encourage new entrepreneurs.

Standing up for local and national concerns

I have an active and successful campaigning record, including leading a campaign to protect our wild peatlands, particularly from industrial energy projects - such as the proposed 200m turbines in Kinross-shire.  I have also brought specific health concerns to the attention of politicians so I know how both parliaments function and how to influence.

Reform’s policies on key issues are needed to revive our economy and restore healthy communities.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/116262/7c8091ef-d264-4cb1-90bf-e64ed3088e90.png

The Perth and North Perthshire seat was created after the 2005 Westminster boundary changes in Scotland and takes in East and Highland Perthshire, the City of Perth and the Carse of Gowrie. Pete held the seat with a majority of 9,641 over the Conservatives, 50.5% of the vote in the 2015 General Election. 

Pete has constituency offices in Perth and Blairgowrie and he consistently ranks as one of Westminster’s hardest working MPs. 

Born in Dunfermline in 1962, Pete was educated at Queen Anne High School and Moray House College, Edinburgh. He lives in Perth, has one son and enjoys walking in the Perthshire hills. 

Pete is the SNP’s Shadow Leader of the House of Commons and the Chair of the Scottish Affairs Committee. He is also Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Intellectual Property and the Writers’ APPG.

I’m proud to be from Peterborough and proud to be your candidate for our city’s next MP. This general election is hugely important. We have failed by Labour MPs too often. This time, let’s get it done.

Peterborough voted to leave the European Union. But MPs keep voting for delay. It's time to get Brexit done and move on as a country. Only a vote for Paul will break the deadlock in Westminster. If Paul wins, Boris Johnson can finish the job by January. Let's get his deal through, with the jobs and investment that Peterborough needs.

Paul will demand our fair share of Cambridgeshire's new police officers. Peterborough needs more officers to get action on crime hotspots and anti-social behaviour. We also need to tackle the local drugs problem. An extra 62 police officers are being recruited already. This includes officers to tackle rural crime.

Paul's transport priority is to dual the A47. This would ease local congestion around Thorney and Eye, while unlocking economic growth for the city. There is already a coalition of groups in favour from Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire and Suffolk. Dualling the A47 has solid evidence behind it. Now we just need the funding committed to our stretch of the project. Paul will lobby government ministers relentlessly to make it happen.

We can make Peterborough's schools better. Paul will prioritise higher standards, using the extra money. Every child deserves the best possible start. Local parents also need a choice of good school places. With extra money on its way for every pupil in every school, our headteachers can target better results.

 Our communities are regularly used as dumping grounds for litter and waste. We need to clean up our city. Paul has a zero-tolerance attitude to flytipping, graffiti and litter. He has reported dumped waste across Peterborough. Residents shouldn't have to live with these ongoing problems. A new approach is needed, building on the stricter fines from the Council's enforcement team. We need more CCTV, more licensing and more bulky waste collections for households.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/1259.png

I live and work in rural Dartmoor, with my two daughters, three dogs and one cat.  I have businesses in Devon, and employ people locally. I have collaborated with and worked on vital campaigns and projects in Devon over many years, I have guest-lectured, spoken and campaigned on local media and been actively involved in a wide variety of important social and environmental issues, not just locally but nationally. I have a long- standing track record for my work with children and women’s human rights and health care, and the rights of the LBGTI community. After a decade of spiralling costs and persistent neglect of many of our basic needs by consecutive Tory governments, nothing is more important to me than championing change and standing solid behind the true wishes and needs of our communities: social care, health care, adequate provision for the needs of children and the elderly, and the protection of under-threat environment.  I am also committed to fighting for the rights of those in work or challenged with access to work. Equality and representation of your voice and needs is my key focus. Community and affordable living with support and representation is key to building happier people and stronger, healthy communities.  Our true needs and concerns have not been heard and not represented effectively, if at all, by the incumbent independent and conservative ‘representative/s’ with West Devon and Torridge, but we, the Liberal Democrats, cannot make changes until we are elected to make change. My core focus will be to firstly meet and listen and then summarise and act on your behalf, whether your focus is farming and subsidies, supporting families, better education, veteran support, or the support of those with greater health and social needs.  I believe we all need to be truly valued to build positive lives and accessible, proud and valued futures. If change is required at a higher level than local council, I will promise to apply pressure wherever it is needed.  I have years of experience working in Whitehall and Westminster, in forums and at a cross party level for NGOs, as well as in Holyrood in Scotland.  I have been proud to work, on occasion, in unity with numerous charities and at the UN and with varying UN Treaty Bodies and Special Rapporteurs and have collaborated with various non-profit organisations and NGOs, as well as with politicians in both the Houses of Parliament and the House of Lords. I have worked, both locally and internationally, supporting policy and children’s human rights changes as well as holding governments locally and nationally to account in varying areas where academic, health, education and social change is desperately needed. I have often had the opportunity to feed into the media to represent voices and needs and address at public events and on discussion panels. I have been proud, and feel honoured, to have received numerous awards and accolades for my work and that of the teams I’ve worked with and driven forward. Changing broken systems and ignored policies and the needs for strong representation within equality and human rights legislation has been my focus for many years.  SEND children and young people in care and with mental health needs have played a huge part in my work, as has betterment and transparency on where representation is needed.  I have been widely recognised for my work as part of iUK and LGBTI+ advocacy. I have never felt more convinced that we need change.  I feel every person regardless of age, gender, religion, ability, race need an equal opportunity to be represented by someone living in and or engaging in their /our community.  I will ensure your voices and demands are heard and I will stand with resolute confidence and in unity with my colleagues to represent you. My campaign promises include supporting people from all walks of life, keeping access to Dartmoor open while protecting the environment, lobbying for better rural transport, better social care for veterans and the elderly, affordable housing for local families and building a thriving and successful community.

It was where I was born and where I live. I come from a family with strong links to the city -- my father served in the Royal Navy as a submariner based in Devonport, and my mum taught at Marjon. I lived in Peverell for ten years before moving to Stoke. I was the first Plymouth MP to be born in the city since Michael Foot represented Devonport in 1945. That's why I am so honoured to have served as the Labour and Co-operative MP for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport since 2017.

Our city doesn't get its fair share of funding from the Conservatives. I am a proud Janner and proud to stand up for our city in Parliament. Since being elected I have spoken over a thousand times in the House of Commons and I have run vocal campaigns demanding a better deal for Plymouth -- for our local NHS, school funding, policing, transport, housing, fishing and the environment. You can find out more on my website.

After the Keyham tragedy in August 2021, I am determined to change our nation's gun laws for the better. Working with groups across our city, I proposed Keyham's Law in Parliament and successfully persuaded the Government to link medical records to firearms licences. I will keep fighting so that no community has to go through what ours has.

As well as being your MP, I have served in a variety of frontbench positions. I was the Shadow Environment Secretary for two years and, since Putin's invasion of Ukraine, I have served as the Shadow Armed Forces Minister. I'm proud to back our Forces, veterans and their families. I've challenged the Tories on veteran poverty, on the scandalous quality of military housing and on their habit of outsourcing defence manufacturing jobs abroad.

With your backing, there's lots I have been proud to achieve. I successfully proposed the UK's first ever National Marine Park at Plymouth Sound. I fought to save Plymouth-based HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark from being scrapped, and for Type 26 frigates to be based in Devonport. I secured £1.8m of support for Keyham and Ford after the tragedy. I campaigned for Plymouth to become a national centre for marine autonomy. And I support thousands of people each year with requests for help. But there's much more to do.

I'm my own man and I'm proud to relentlessly stand up for my city. Plymouth deserves a better deal -- our fair share - and I won't stop until we get it.

I grew up in the City and went to a comprehensive school in Crownhill.

Today, I am a history writer, penning books about late-medieval/early-Tudor England.  My first book was published in 2023 and I am already working away at the follow up.  I also work as a self-employed communications consultant for a range of global businesses.

For many years, I served as a youth worker and a community volunteer.  I worked with people from a range of backgrounds who were battling with a variety of circumstances, that first inspired me to run for Parliament.

For eight years, I worked for one of the UK’s biggest Academy trusts, which was responsible for turning around failing schools.  Here, I saw the difference that government policy can make.  With a fresh injection of leadership, and by expecting the best form each young person we witnessed students from disadvantaged backgrounds achieving the same results as other learners.  I am proud that after more than a decade of a Conservative government, standards in Plymouth’s schools are much higher than they were when I was a teenager.

As a type 1 diabetic and a permanent outpatient of Derriford Hospital, I know the importance of good healthcare.  We must improve access to GPs and make it easier for people to get appointments.  But from my time as a youth and community worker, I also believe that politicians have to turn their attention to deeper issues such as loneliness and isolation. When these are allowed to fester in secrecy, they turn into healthcare concerns and blight people’s lives.

Before moving back home to Plymouth, I was a Councillor in Croydon, South London.  While in opposition, it was devastating to see the Labour council bankrupt the borough, making huge and swift cuts to essential services inevitable.  Labour’s failures were a direct consequence of their decision to focus on high-profile and eye-grabbing initiatives while neglecting the basics.  This strengthened my resolve to be the kind of politician that gives due attention to the issues that really make a huge difference to people’s lives.  Even when those issues are less likely to hit the headlines.

Plymouth is my home.  I was born here, went to school here and spent years working for Plymouth’s businesses.  It would be the honour of a lifetime to represent Plymouth Sutton and Devonport in Parliament.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/5898/0ef8dbb5-a566-48a0-be86-1affba34b202.png

I will listen to electors and be visible within the constituency

I will represent residents when they have a concern or problem

Amanda has Portsmouth and its people at her heart. As a longstanding community activist, she has experience, knowledge and understanding of a wide range and of local issues and needs.



About her selection as Labour candidate for Portsmouth North she says: ""I am extremely honoured, and so very proud, to have been reselected. For too long Portsmouth North has been run by Tory politicians who simply do not care about our public services and the opportunities and, to be honest, about the people who live in our communities. They have led from the front and been proud of the chaos and hardship they've caused. The cost of living crisis is affecting all areas of our city and 14 years of coalition and Conservative governments have given little to the people of Portsmouth North. Allowing austerity to decimate services and put thousands of kids and families into poverty, increasing rents and mortgages, food and heating bills and lacking the inspiration that is needed to turn it around. Portsmouth people are proud people and deserve an MP who feels that same pride and wants our city and the people in it to succeed. The time has come for us to say 'No'. Portsmouth North needs real change and only a Labour candidatecan offer that.

I have also worked in the ward for  a couple of years. 

My son has been blue-lighted to A&E with breathing problems four times before his second birthday exacerbated by air pollution. Hence, I want more done to combat air pollution. COVID has had more impact in reducing pollution levels than the introduction of the CAZ. The CAZ needs to be larger and more stringent, in line with residents wishes, to include Kingston Crescent, Kingston Road and Fratton Road. 

In addition, I have signed the South East Climate Alliance ABCD pledge to ensure that council funds are not invested in fossil fuels. 

I wish to see more electric buses run across the city - PCC has had a hand in acquiring 40 electric buses across Fareham, Gosport and Portsmouth. 140 buses run in Portsmouth alone.

 Bus routes across and into Portsmouth need a rethink to reduce journey times and provide access to parts of the city such as Portsmouth College, Anchorage Park and Ocean Retail park from all parts of the city including Hilsea. Access to Whale Island, HMNB Portsmouth - Trafalgar Gate, and Portsmouth International Port by bus needs addressing. Residents have spoken to me about lack of public transport to these locations. 

Portsmouth is an ideal location to build the living streets of the future where we rely less on our cars and more on public transport, walking snd cycling. 

Having spent over 8 years in the Royal Navy I found that I could often move more quickly around the city on a bicycle than by car.

Portsmouth needs a joined up cycling strategy that makes it safer, easier and  quicker to travel through, across and around our city - I have nearly been hit by cars and vans on several occasions.

Making it cheaper and easier to cycle, walk or take public transport will ease the congestion in our city and reduce the air pollution. 

In addition, properly insulating the city's housing stock will reduce people's bills in a time of rising prices as well as help cut pollution further!  I support the investment in insulation across our city from private housing to publicly owned housing. 

As the Green candidate I have vehemently opposed the Tipner West development and am working with the Hampshire and IoW Wildlife Trust to provide an alternative vision for the site. As opposed to the proposed developments that would destroy legally protected habitats.

Real consideration for our environment, investment into health and social care, a commitment to global peace, electoral reform, and promoting inclusion & diversity within society.

Maida Vale has been my home since 1978. My degrees are BA Econ Hons (University of Manchester) and MSc (London School of Economics). My professional background primarily revolves around financial management in both industry and the charity sector. I dedicated a significant portion of time to caring for my elderly parents who were Holocaust survivors, which profoundly shaped my values and volunteering/political activities.

Prior to joining the party and simultaneously, I worked on hunger-related issues, and campaigned, since 1982, for peace and human rights in Israel-Palestine with Jewish and joint Jewish-Palestinian groups, including Jewish-Arab Dialogue and Jews for Justice for Palestinians.

After joining in 1997, I played a pivotal role in establishing West Central London Green Party in time for the first London Assembly elections, being active until 2002 when I concentrated on Israeli-Palestinian issues until 2017. In my role as Chair of Jewish Greens, I have been spending quite some time recently – following the Hamas attacks on October 7th and the subsequent Israeli attacks on Gaza – on this and related issues.

My other political foci are a Green New Deal; Universal Basic Income which would help resolve poverty and homelessness, and improve mental health; and the appreciation for diversity in our communities.

Beyond politics, I volunteer at Crisis at Christmas, enjoy exercising and shopping on my tricycle, tending to my plants, and reading; and am staff to three cats.

Dave is a scientist, a dad, and a sports lover. He has lived in Reading since 2017 and works for an international organisation dedicated to protecting land and farmers. As a hardworking councillor, Dave is a tireless campaigner for cleaner air, safer streets, and sticking up for the needs of local people. He is out knocking on residents’ doors all year round. You can expect more of the same hard work if Dave McElroy is elected as an MP.

In Reading Central, the Greens have the second largest group of councillors ahead of both the Conservatives and Lib Dems.

Speaking after being selected, Councillor Dave McElroy said: “We are all struggling with the cost-of-living crisis. Reading is blighted by congestion, air pollution and speeding, a lack of affordable housing, and a shortage of NHS dentists. I have been working on these issues as a councillor. If elected as an MP, I would be able to do this on a national level.

“The Green Party is now in second place on Reading Council ahead of both the Conservatives and Lib Dems. With more Green councillors, we have been able to make more of a difference on the council. With more MPs, we would be able to make more of a difference nationally.

“As your MP, I would also be able to act as a moral anchor on national issues, like taking the climate crisis seriously and condemning terror and genocide in all forms.

“Voters can expect me to stand up for people, planet and improving our quality of life. As a principle, I will always act on what I believe to be in the best interests of Reading residents, not the best interests of career politicians or the super-rich. With me, there will be no surprises, no excuses, just getting on with making the town fairer, greener and cleaner.

“The solution to the problems created by those in power cannot be more of the same.  I urge the people of Reading to think about what matters to them, who has got us into this mess, what the Green Party has to offer, and be inspired to vote Green.”",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/82840-f2e70d81-368f-40ea-a198-6e5636fc45b6.png

Olivia, who lives in the constituency with her young family, is committed to delivering more support for families and young people - with more teachers in local schools, free breakfast clubs for all primary school kids and much-needed improvements to childcare provision.



As the daughter of a local policeman, Olivia is determined to get more police back on the beat and reverse the collapse in the number of crimes solved. She'll also work to get our NHS back on its feet with more appointments with local doctors and dentists.



Speaking with voters across the constituency, Olivia has heard how fed up people are with this failing Conservative government. Mortgages have gone up. Our beautiful streams and rivers are full of sewage. It feels like nothing works in Britain anymore.



Enough is enough. Elect Olivia locally and a Labour government nationally to deliver the fresh start Reading West and Mid Berkshire so desperately needs.

Ross is a lifelong Conservative, believing passionately in the need to give people the chance to aspire and reach their potential, fulfilling their life’s ambitions and reaching their goals. He is a firm believer that the role of government is to create a suitable environment and provide the infrastructural support to make this possible, for everyone who applies themselves to the task.

He believes in making your own luck, and funnily enough, the more that you put in, the luckier you are.

As teenager Ross tried to found a Conservative club, in Glasgow! He didn’t find so many fellow travellers in 1980’s Glasgow, but he felt so strongly that he has benefited from the Conservatives assisted places scheme, that he wanted to do his bit to try to perpetuate the scheme for others that were following.

He is known to some of his prospective voters as the Bradfield Ward councillor on the West Berkshire Council, a seat he has held since the May 2019 election. He held a number of roles over the years and was eventually selected as the leader of the Conservative group, following the May 2023 election.

To others he is a new prospect and he has been out canvassing on his new political patch, trying to reach as many of his extended audience as he can.

He believes that the United Kingdom has not benefitted from the Constitutional changes that New Labour introduced, under Tony Blair and that not enough attention has been paid to reversing them.

One of the serious consequences of these ‘reforms’ has been the separation of responsibilities between those who raise your taxes, ministers in the government, and those who spend it, Quangos and other Non-Governmental Organisations over which the government of the day has no direct authority.

This contradicts the basic civil covenant of ‘No Taxation without Representation’ established throughout history in differing guises, but recognised as early as the Magna Carta, the English Civil War and was contributory to America seeking independence from the United Kingdom following the attempted introduction of the ‘Stamp Tax’.

He is also frustrated that people voted for major changes in 2016 when they voted for Brexit, yet successive governments have struggled to meet those aspirations.

He is further frustrated that people seem to expect Government to take more and more control over their lives, especially since COVID, and that successive Governments seem happy to oblige and expand this remit even further, paid for through even greater taxation.

If he is elected, he will try to use his position as an MP to change the Government’s attitude to these issues and move to a system that encourages people to become more self-reliant, developing their own skills and keeping more of their earnings so that they can live the life they choose. People know best how to spend their earnings, not government",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/68128.png

I have never stopped fighting to defend industry, oppose Tory cuts to our schools and hospitals, protect the vulnerable, and secure investment. Every day I have made sure Teesside’s voice is heard loud and clear in Westminster.

Fighting to bring jobs to our area will always be my top priority. Decent, skilled jobs that give local families on Teesside the security of being able to pay the bills and provide a good standard of living. Not the insecure jobs, zero hours’ contracts, and bogus self-employment that we have seen under this Tory Government.

I want our children to learn in the best schools so there is no ceiling to their ambition and will fight for the investment needed to deliver that. Keeping our streets safe means we need to invest in our police too, not cut funding as the Tories have done leading to fewer bobbies on the beat. Our campaign for tougher legislation on animal cruelty must also continue if we are to get justice for Baby and Scamp.

Seven years of Tory austerity has hit Teesside. They closed our steelworks and our closing our medical centres. Now they are coming back with policies like the dementia tax, cutting the winter fuel allowance, scrapping free schools meals, and slashing school budgets.

I am standing again so I can continue fighting back for Teesside and securing the jobs, investment and decent public services we need.

She's a Midlands girl born and bred, and has spent most of her life in the Dorridge/Solihull area. If elected, she has pledged to make her family home in Redditch. She currently lives in Dorridge, a 10 minute drive from Redditch, and she knows Redditch well from visiting over the years for work, and to bring her cub pack kayaking on the Arrow Valley Lake. 

Rachel has a background in business, after she married her husband David, they set up a Birmingham based publishing company, specialising in IT and software content. Over the years she faced the challenges and setbacks that many small business owners experience, but the business eventually flourished and now employs people from all over the Midlands area including Redditch people, as well as having an international presence.

She's a technology entrepreneur who also recently co-founded an HR software business, providing a platform for SMEs to use the latest technology tools to run their businesses more efficiently. The business was selected to participate in the Entrepreneurial Spark programme in Birmingham.

Rachel has always worked in her local community since she started at age 16 helping inner city children come on summer camps to Alvechurch. Over the years she has been a voluntary worker and fundraiser for the National Childbirth Trust, a Sunday School Teacher, as well as spending 15 years as a Beaver, Cub, Scout Leader and Assistant District Commissioner for Cubs. She recently completed a term as an elected Parent Governor at a Birmingham school, with responsibility for the curriculum area. She helped set up the LoveBrum charity supporting grassroots volunteer-led charities that don't receive government funding. 

She started her charity, Skilled and Ready, because she has always been passionate about helping young people get the best start in life. She believes that a great education is the key to fulfilling potential and she said, ""Skilled and Ready fits a real need. Having run a business I've seen the skills gap for real. We link the skills needed by local employers to the curriculum. We help to open young people's eyes to the opportunities here for them and also to support them making the right choices. I'm delighted that schools across the country have recently put hundreds of learners through the Skilled and Ready which will help them get a good job after they leave school""

Speaking after her selection to stand as a candidate for the Redditch County constituency, Rachel said, ""If I am elected as your MP on 8th June, I will be a fighter for every community in the constituency, working tirelessly to deliver strong and stable leadership for the people of Redditch county. I will use everything I've learned in my business career, and my political career as an active campaigner on the issues that matter. I'll stand with Theresa May to deliver a Brexit that's right for us, securing our future, a strong economy, and the investment needed into our public services in this growing town and beautiful county"".",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/4161_YvSZ7NH.png

A Green Campaign for the European Elections must highlight how social justice and environmental sustainability are two sides of the same coin. This vision, combined with sufficient collective action, can and must transform our politics and radically change economics - for a better future and Europe.

I would apply my experience as a Green councillor (since 2010) and as SE Chair (since 2014) to this challenge, continuing Keith Taylor’s leadership of a strong team in Brussels and the region. I believe I have the humility and integrity, commitment and experience to be elected as an effective MEP. I have been a Green Party member since 2005. I currently serve as a Surrey County Councillor and Reigate and Banstead Borough Councillor. I previously served the Green Party nationally (as campaigns coordinator, on conferences committee, reviewing policy) and have stood in general and EU elections.

I have long campaigned for environmental and social justice (including through CND, CPRE, UKWIN and Greenpeace). I have helped start new campaigns (including #NoNewRunways and locally) and served as a Trustee for local charities (furniture reuse and local volunteering). My activism started leading a Friends of the Earth student group helping defeat the Durham bypass. I joined the Green Party after returning from working in Sudan, Vietnam and Bangladesh as a Chartered Engineer and Environmentalist where I experienced climate impacts and corruption first hand. I have had the privilege of leading a small team of green councillors in Surrey where we punch above our weight - securing budget amendments, motions and making a real difference locally.

I have extensive media experience, mostly as a councillor (print media, radio, some TV) and in general and European elections. I have spoken in many public meetings and rallies; including supporting Keith Taylor MEP at events on affordable housing, flooding, oil drilling, airport expansion (e.g. on how we can provide genuinely affordable housing and protect our countryside, against nuclear power, Trident, council cuts and austerity, biofuels and incineration – and on the fairer society and green jobs we must create instead, on hope and green politics and much more), and supported legal challenges.

In addition I have published and presented widely as a core member of Green House across the UK and EU (including at the Green European Foundation COP24 side-event) including on industrial strategy for a post-growth Britain on how dealing with climate change will re-localise the UK and EU economy and what Facing up to Climate Reality looks like (forthcoming).

We need a reformed and far Greener Europe. We must inspire and energise the UK in the face of tired politics, declaring a Climate Emergency, setting clear green lines to stop airport expansion and oil extraction, and realising sufficient alternatives with integrity, honesty and clarity. I would welcome the opportunity to serve as your Green MEP. Together we must Take Back Hope.""",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/439.png

I was elected in May this year – it was a huge moment for us collectively and I’m very proud of my colleagues and all our members who worked so hard to help us get elected.  In my work as a councillor I’m focusing on pushing the Council to do all it can to help residents insulate their houses and install low-carbon technology like solar panels. As a group, we have been pushing for our Council to become a registered social landlord so that we can insist on the highest standards of energy efficiency of future housing. We’ve also made sure that our Council gives more help to residents on low incomes. Before I became an active member of the Green Party I used to be involved in a lot of community projects like a hydro power project on the River Thames, and running energy advice projects to help people save money on their energy bills and cut carbon emissions. I also ran projects to help residents in Lewisham and Greenwich get grant funding for vital upgrades to their insulation and heating systems. Now I work for a renewable energy company that installs solar pv and electric vehicle chargepoints. If I get elected, I’ll use that experience to build better policy. It’s absolutely vital that the next government ramps up support for home insulation and renewables.

I got into politics because I saw that we need a positive vision in government at all levels. In the Green Party we share a common purpose to build a sustainable way of life, to preserve the planet’s biodiversity and resources, to create a future for future generations. It’s that positive vision that people are crying out for – because we all know that time is running out. Please give me your vote in the Richmond Park constituency at the general election.

Caring for Our Police

Caring for Each Other

About Graham:

President of the Liberal Democrat Lawyers  

Studied Law (Aberystwyth) and European Law (College of Europe). 

Has an MBA (City University Business School) and a research degree in Banking Reform (University of Kent).

Worked in the City and as a Legal Aid lawyer in Lambeth, Westminster, and Chatham. 

Former Kent County Councillor and co-chair of the Kent Fire & Public Protection committee. 

Previously lived in Maidstone and Lenham, now lives in Rochester with a 15-year-old cat, Crackers.

Graham stands for:

Neighbourhood Policing – from the ground up, not the top down.

Looking for radical solutions – tackling the root of problems  faced by our police.

Seeking efficiency but caring for the police force who serve us.

Graham and Liberal Democrats believe:

Crime policy must be based on the evidence of what works to prevent and solve crime. Strengthening neighbourhood policing as a local policing presence gives people confidence that their safety is being cared for. Anti-social behaviour has to be eradicated. More preventative work is required, particularly through joined-up working with other public services. Too many victims of crime have a negative experience in the system. Too many criminals are not required to confront their behaviour. More action required to tackle violence against women and girls. Too few prisoners receive effective pre-release support. Re-offending rates remain unacceptably high. A new preventative, health-based approach is required to tackle drug and alcohol misuse. Stop and Search remains a source of deep mistrust between the police and the public and requires reform. Kent Police have a large budget. The PCC must be vigilant to ensure that it is well spent. Bureaucratic waste means fewer frontline services.

In the late 80’s, whilst working with bee keepers on a Kibbutz, I shared a room with a physicist who explained to me global warming and what scientists believed was happening as a result of burning fossil fuels. I started then to take an interest in what governments and environmentalists were doing to lessen the impact of climate change

I joined the Green Party to promote environmental policies and try to ensure that the future isn’t a barren wasteland of pillaged rainforests, contaminated countryside and lifeless oceans. But in addition to the most important issues of sustainability, environmental protection and climate change is social justice, fairness and equality. A fantastic, healthy and vibrant planet is no legacy for future generations unless there is a responsible, educated and thriving population to enjoy it

From campaigning to support victims and survivors of Child Sexual Exploitation, fighting to defend our steel industry, or to improve our local public services, like buses and the NHS, I have always put Rotherham first.

For too long, our town has been ignored by decision makers in London and neglected by a Tory Government that neither understands nor cares about our needs and aspirations. I give my all to make sure your views are heard and to speak out on behalf of Rotherham and my constituents.

In addition to my work representing Rotherham, I am also Chair of the International Development Committee, a role that lets me scrutinise Government spend and make sure tax payers get value for their money.

I always value hearing from my constituents.

People ask “Why do we have a Commissioner?”

The Chief Constable has operational responsibilty for Warwickshire Police. The Commissioner holds the Police to account for their work helping us stay safe. The Commissioner has oversight of the county’s criminal justice system, including commissioning services to support victims of crime, funding services with local partner agencies, that amongst other things, help reduce re-offending, prevent alcohol and substance misuse and improve community safety. 

This election is about who will bring fresh impetus to the Commissioner’s role providing a fair deal for residents.

Now it’s time to ACT and vote for a Commissioner who offers:

A. more Accountability to residents about how the Police help make us feel safe in our communities eg. through more community policing;

C. more Community engagement amongst all communities with the Police, public sector agencies, voluntary and community groups working together to improve community safety.

T. more Transparency, in-person and in digital media, about how the Commissioner and the Police are spending our money in a sustainable way to help keep us safe. 

It’s TIME FOR CHANGE 

It’s time for the Liberal Democrats to take responsibility for the safety of our communities.

I’m offering experience serving residents, as a local councillor and in the local voluntary and community sector. 

I am a District Councillor. I was born in Warwickshire and for more than 30 years have been active in communities in Kenilworth. I have worked in business and in the community sector and currently work at Coventry University’s Centre for Peace and Security.

On May 2nd vote Liberal Democrat, for more openness, transparency and accountability.

Better business, education and livelihoods. That’s what you’ll get with a Reform government, along with our no nonsense, common sense policies which will forge and sustain an excellent future for our nation. We can Brexit properly, ditch the WEF and end harmful agendas like “Net Zero”. It’s all planned and costed - and the prospect is so exciting.

I love Rugby. There is no other area that I would consider representing. I grew up in Binley Woods until I was eighteen then moved to Rugby in 2015. I spent a bit of time in Coventry over the past few years whilst caring for my Dad, but my work and ties remained in Rugby so it’s always been home. 

I know how badly we have been let down and under-represented here for so long, and I know how desperate people are for change and to have a representative that truly cares about our people and our area with no personal agenda. I’m not a politician - sorry if that offends anyone - but we need more voices like mine in parliament, people that don’t come from privilege and live in the real world, understanding the every day struggles. 

My top three priorities are to push for improvements to the urgent care department at St Cross hospital by having it staffed by registrars 24/7 so that more people can be treated on site without having to go to UHCW, to reform local SEND provision by working closely with other local representatives to champion parent & pupil views to bring about urgent improvements in the local offering and to enhance youth provision, enabling all young people to have access to youth clubs which provide them with a safe space to socialise away from phones and consoles and learn skills to help prepare them for adulthood and improve their mental health. 

My focus on our young people is especially strong, as we simply cannot expect a successful future if we continue to neglect our next generation.

The lack of regeneration of Rugby town centre is also a key focus of mine, as there has been a lot of funding provided which hasn’t been utilised, and a lot of false promises with no action. I firmly believe that those best placed to regenerate the centre are those that do business there and visit there. A task force should be created of local business owners, developers and visitors to implement the initiatives that people want to see in their town centre.

Are you sick of politicians? Who isn't? I'm not a politician and would consider it an insult to be classed as one. Anyone who has a career or some kind of 'standing' at stake is corruptible as we have seen all too clearly over the last few years. I'm not interested in a career and am resourceful enough not to need to put my nose in the trough. We see the desperation to hang onto their well paid job with expenses the people of Britain can't even imagine, and their position in the party or government, to say nothing of future media careers and directorships. They are literally saying anything to win inspite of all previous evidence as to their true colours. The manifestos are worth less than toilet paper - there is nothing that holds them to any promise and let's face it, were we promised any of what we have actually received - organised 'illegal' immigration aided and abetted by the government, prevention of lawful activities such as work, going to the pub, meeting friends, going to school organised by the government, illegal use of psychological techniquest ot manipulate compliance, surveillance, watwer companies dumping sewerage in rivers that had just become clean enough to swim in, planes so polluting they form clouds and rain with their trails, NetZero tyranny that they exempt themselves from, toxic pesticides waved in after years of successful resistance, banks refusing to lend and forcing people out of homes into expensive rented accommodation, embroiing our armed forces other people's war (and yet war has been illegal for this country unless we are under direct attack since 1928), the hijacking of gay rights to suit a transgender agenda.....nobody made an informed choice at the last election because nobody was told about these policies. Locally, who voted for massive Minecraft-style housing estates rather than preserving and enhancing our countryside and green spaces? Who really wanted more surveillance - I'm waiting for any evidence this reduces any real crime or is even used by police to solve it. Who thought they'd rather have fly tipping rather than reasonable 'recycling'centres - tips- that can responsibly dispose of waste and are cheap? Direct democracy would allow us to challenge any of this.  I'm standing because I can no longer watch the destruction of the country and the future of our kids. I am going to make sure that I can look my children in the eye and say I did all I could. Elections are a small part of the solution, but they do allow us to pattern interrupt the staged Punch & Judy show that the LabCons put on for us every 5 years. They clearly see this election as a simple baton handover.  My promise is to listen, do the next right thing, review all legislation to see if it is unlawful (which it is if it violates our rights by birth), I support the campaign for Direct Democracy so any legilslation has to face a referendum (Swiss model) - that should cut down the rush to legislate. I will push for prosecutions and reclamation of the billions of pounds transferred fraudulently from us to 'their' oligarch corporate friends (the biggest wealth transfer in history!), support and invest in community level energy solutions so that we don't pay good money to subsidise German and French energy and bills (we do at the moment) - i propose Green Hydrogen but maybe you have better ideas. I am actively seeking and implementing solutions now that I expect to be able to free us and make communities self-sufficient and  independent of corporate interests. Effective healthcare, outside of the pharmaceutically dictated model. Schooling - one size clearly fits nobody- have we ever had a more down trodden, helpless generation? There are lots of great models - they are generally much smaller scale, more tailored to individual people and not based on who can sit still for 5 hours a day. Many models, and indeed previous and present practices, actually prepare children to be healthy, functional, critical thinkers who can carve their own path instead of trying to fit into a defined rut. Our transport infrastructure is based on causing maximum inconvenience and to deter travel, often backed with cameras and fines or cancelled trains and manufactured strikes. Spending on roads and public transport rather than surveillance would be a start as would using a sensible road surface like recycled rubber rather than obediently buying oil industry byproducts. I'll give a shout out to farmers at this point - has an industry ever been under so much pressure from top down government? Farmers, you should be free to produce food and make a good living from it. We should all have fresh, cheap, local food. This is not novel - market gardens in cities and farms that keep a steady year round supply are not a new concept. To take our farmers and create a food crisis is immoral and irresponsible. I believe in very local small administration for the people, not government by supranational organisations and corporations forcing their whackadoodle agendas on us via Westminster - or WEFminster a it is becoming commonly referred to. And what of the media? - getting rid of the almost monopoly state is crucial for free, honest and independent reporting. As it is there are only a few media companies now, often with the same shareholders, and they spend their time reporting within the constraining limits of their paymaster's narrative, and held to that by OfCom. We cannot know the truth and make informed choices without free dissemination of information and hearing from a variety of sources.  I was born and bred in Rushcliffe. My parents were at the heart of villagelife running the shop, and it became ever more onerous as government and councils became ever more megalomaniacal. My family, nuclear and wider, are here and I hope very much to make it a wonderful place for their children and grandchildren. I am now proudly fully involved in village life. I use the amenities and help organise  and join in events and groups. I have lots of experience of and knowledge of the area and our people, and am proud that I have no experience whatsoever of government. This is a huge advantage from my point of view as MP's and councillors seem only experienced in messing things up for us. To make such a mess requires intent as nobody is that incompetent.  The ConLabs try hard to put fear into people, talking about the need for 'serious' politicians with experience and knowledge of the system. How's that working out for us? They have about the only job that requires no training, experience or qualification and they have tens of thousands of Whitehall bureaucrats to make their wishes come true. Basically, the definition of insanity is to keep doing the same thing and expecting a different result. ConLabs are (as Galloway likes to say) two cheeks of the same bottom (polite version). You change nothing by voting for them. They have the party faithful few to do that - they are a minority, but their members are the only voters to turn out - everyone else las learned to feel helpless and like they can't make a difference. I would say, if you don't like who's on your ballot paper, stand for yourself or at least write 'no confidence in the system' or similar on your paper. These papers are counted and affect the final percentages. If you don't vote your silence is taken as tacit agreement to be treated in anyway the minority ConLabs choose. Remember you have the right to thrive, the reason you don't is because government has colluded with an unelected global corporatocracy to make it so. Happy Independent's Day.

Dr. James Moore has lived in Leicestershire and Rutland for much of his life. Educated at John Cleveland College, Hinckley, he holds degrees from the University of Oxford and the University of Manchester. James has worked in education for most of his career and currently teaches history and politics at the University of Leicester. He has been a local campaigner for several decades, serving as a member of Liberal Democrat controlled Hinckley and Bosworth Borough council, and working to prevent crime in the community.

Reverse the Cuts and Bring Back Local Policing

Dr. James Moore is campaigning to reverse the cuts in local policing and to prevent police services being centralised at Leicester. He is determined to see the restoration of local criminal investigation teams so that the police can really get to know local people and local communities. He is also calling for a greater focus on crimes that affect ordinary people in their everyday lives, especially burglary and street violence.

Liberal Democrat Priorities - Keeping Streets and Communities Safe

Leicestershire's Liberal Democrat councils work with the police all-year-round to protect the community. A Liberal Democrat Police Commissioner will:

- Extend community policing and community patrols - Introduce a 'Street Safe' initiative to reduce the fear of street violence - Improve street lighting, where it will help deter crime - Tackle dangerous driving and speeding - Adopt a more preventative approach towards domestic violence - Tackle burglary and develop new burglary prevention initiatives with local communities - Enhance efforts to tackle drug crime and county lines gangs - Develop more community neighbourhood watch and crime prevention initiatives - Provide better support to victims of crime - Supporting the Police - Helping, Not Hindering

A Liberal Democrat Police Commissioner will work closely and constructively with the Chief Constable to improve local policing. Liberal Democrats will ensure communities have a direct say in local policing and crime prevention. On the rare occasions when things go wrong, Liberal Democrats will work hard to support the police to put things right. The police have a difficult job to do - they need to be supported and not undermined.

More Police, Not More Politicians

The Liberal Democrats believe that the Office of the Police Commissioner costs far too much. Dr. James Moore will cut the cost of the Office and reduce the number of paid advisors within it to a minimum. Liberal Democrats want to see more police, not more politicians and political advisors.

Unlike the Labour and Conservative Police Commissioner, Dr. Moore will not take the excessive salary of the office and will only take home the equivalent of his current salary as a university teacher. The money saved will be donated to projects for disadvantage young people across the county.

Tory and Labour Commissioners mean More of the Same

We have had Conservative and Labour Police Commissioners, yet almost a decade on we have far fewer police in our counties than ten years ago. While Leicestershire's Liberal Democrat Councils have invested in crime prevention, the Labour City Council has cut the youth services that keep young people away from crime. Liberal Democrats will fight for a restoration of police numbers, improve youth and community services and bring back local policing.

James Moore added ""Liberal Democrats oppose the excessive salaries and cost of the Police Commissioners. We want to see more police, not more politicians and political advisors.""

""Liberal Democrats are fighting for a return to local policing. We need more police in our local towns and villages. We do not want everything centralised in Leicester.""

""We have had Labour and Conservative police commissioners in Leicestershire and Rutland, but they have made little difference. Police numbers in our counties are now considerably lower than a decade ago. The Labour City Council has cut the youth services that help prevent crime. Liberal Democrats will fight to increase police numbers and tackle the crimes that most concern local people, such as burglary and street violence.""",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/74316-e380c098-c6c2-4a40-a1fa-b56e65667cae.png

The last councillor election I had a major part to win the Conservative councillor at Hyde(Werneth).

Growth and Development of GMCA When I first assumed the chairmanship of GMCA, our membership was modest, with only 20 dedicated individuals.

GMCA is more than just a committee; it is a community group that aims to foster unity and support among the Bangladeshi community in Greater Manchester. We organize multiple events throughout the year, providing platforms for cultural exchange, community support, and celebration.

A Landmark Event: The 19th June Gathering One of the most significant milestones in my tenure as chairman was organizing one of the largest events for the Bangladeshi community on the 19th of June. This grand event, held in Oldham, attracted over 3000 attendees, marking it as one of the biggest gatherings in our community's history.

The event was graced by distinguished guests, including the Ambassador from the Bangladesh Embassy the Mayor of Tameside Council, the Mayor of Oldham, MP Afzal Khan, and several other notable figures. Their presence underscored the importance of our community and the strength of our cultural heritage.

The success of this event was a collaborative effort, reflecting the dedication and hard work of our GMCA members.

As an army officer who served on the frontline in Afghanistan, I can rally morale, engage national leaders and get tough things done.

I’m registered partially-sighted, so I’ve lived the frustrations of accessibility — and successfully campaigned for change.

Finally, as an experienced civil servant and clean energy strategist, I know how to navigate Westminster. I’ll fight to bring Salisbury a brighter future, with an economy that works as hard as you do. Where local business can thrive.

Where our rivers are clean and our farms are climate-resilient. And our historic city is celebrated and supported to thrive. 

That’s why I’m standing up as your committed and energetic Labour MP,  who is always happy to listen and proud to put Salisbury first.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/116431/17a5328a-6a6f-4a3f-971e-10678676de32.png

Too many people in our society are constrained by the inequality within our systems to reach their full potential, whether this is in lack of access to decent jobs, affordable housing, or a weak pound affecting household budgets.

​I am passionate about speaking up and speaking out on behalf of those who struggle to be heard. My career to date has focussed on supporting vulnerable people and enabling them to live their best possible lives. It is why I worked in Westminster to change laws around housing tenants’ rights to legal protections, and why I campaigned for greater protection for stalking victims through the Stalking Protection Act 2019.

​The Liberal Democrats made great strides during the coalition government to work towards a more equal society, but this is being eroded by the Conservatives. As your candidate, I will continue to work for all people to have an equal stake in our society, secure jobs, and decent housing…

Working in sustainability, I saw first-hand the threat climate change is having, and will have, both at home and abroad. I worked specifically on changes to renewable energy tariffs, fuel poverty and behaviour change, lobbying government officials and the Chair for the Committee on Climate Change to ensure the best deal for sustainable businesses, the least well-off and our environment.

We are running out of time to make the changes needed to avoid climate disaster. The UK must take climate change seriously and this means having a longer-term vision than most politicians tend to.

​As Salisbury’s strong voice, I will continue to fight for action on air pollution, better investment in renewable technologies, reduction in plastic pollution, and the highest energy standards for all buildings.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/71613.png

As a boy, I lived in Godley Road, Salisbury and attended Harnham Primary School, before going to school in Codford St Mary.  I lived in Tidworth, Bulford and finally in Manor Road, Salisbury. My first jobs were in Salisbury.

Why am I seeking election as your PCC?  I am not a career politician.  I am a Queen’s Counsel.  But we all sense that our criminal justice system and indeed, our freedoms, are at a critical stage.  Crime is always with us, but it can be reduced and criminals deterred.  Police funds are finite.  That means, we must set priorities.  Not those passing fads, which we are told we should want, but those you actually want.  Morale in your police force, coupled with the support of the law abiding public are vital objectives.  They come from leadership.  Our county is not immune from organised crime, nor from internet fraud, indeed in the latter case we are probably more vulnerable than most London boroughs.

I believe in democracy, true democracy,
by, for and of the People.
Not by for and of the party,
 
“They’re all the same. Doesn't matter who you vote for”
 
Half of us don’t even bother to vote
Bums on seats that’s what it’s all about, so get yours down to the polling station on Election Day and vote for me and I promise you one thing I won’t be, is the same. Or do what you usually do, sit at home and play no part in the electoral process. Do that though, and don’t come moaning to me or anyone else about the way the country’s run.
You’ll get what you deserve.
 
You want a protest vote, fine. You want someone to stand up in parliament and tell them we have had enough, fine.
You want a people’s champion, fine.
Vote for me.
 
You want more of the same-vote for anyone else or do what you normally do, don’t bother.
 
They will all tell you that only they can sort it, that their party is better that the others and that they will do a better job.
 
Me, I tell you now, I haven’t got all the answers, but I promise you this, I might not be better but I can’t possibly be worse.
 
WHY INDEPENDENT FOR SALISBURY?
 
Only an Independent will support a good idea or oppose a bad one in Parliament, irrespective of any party policy.
 
Martin Bell has shown us that you do not have to be a Party
or a ‘yes man’ to make a difference.
 
If you want Salisbury to have a voice in Westminster,
I’m your man.
 
If elected, I will hold my surgeries on our streets, at markets, car boot sales, pubs, clubs and shopping centres, making him more approachable than any of our current MPs.
 
An Independent does not subscribe to any Party’s policies; he or she will fight for what they know to be the wishes of the electorate.
 
I will make it my business to find out what you want, and as an Independent would not be tied to any Party Whip as to whether I support it or not.
 
rthur, if elected, would represent YOU not this Party or that, and only Arthur as an Independent will ask the government, whoever controls it, the awkward questions that no other opposition member can. A peoples (not a party) champion
 
Only Arthur Pendragon can fight for Salisbury with an Independent voice

First, I would like to say a huge thank you to everyone, I have met so far, who has made me feel so at home.

Here is a little bit about myself, I am a former deputy Leader and currently a cabinet lead, in the south London borough of Greenwich. An area that has many of the similar characteristics of Sevenoaks and Swanley, it has areas of affluence and pockets of both unseen and seen poverty, and at the same time, it's residents are facing some of the same challenges, like the cost of living crisis, a local NHS that is under enormous pressures, and a lack of affordable housing. I want to fight to change this.

Also Sevenoaks and Swanley are experiencing regeneration and growth, which again is similar to an area I currently represent. I know what it takes to bring key stakeholders together to fight for investment and deliver the changes that people want. I am used to working at both the strategic and local level to challenge and bring positive change to an area experiencing growth.

I am used to working in and winning a challenging seat. Since 2014, I have been a ward councillor in the marginal ward, a seat that have been targeted by the main opposition in that area. Having the experience, skillsets and resilience to fight a chanllenging seat will be important to fighting for Labour in this part of Kent and I believe I have it.

I am a strong and active Labour campaigner. Since 2008, I have worked on all the General Elections, and London mayoral, Europeans and local council election campaigns for the Labour Party, as well as numerous by-elections. Also I have been the CLP Secretary and held numerous positions at both constituency and branch level.

Outside of local government, I am the President of the National Members Council (NMC) for the Coop Group, a national position within the cooperative movement. In the role, I chair a 100-member council and represent the voice of over five million members, helping to champion cooperative solutions within a retail sector.

I have strong communications skills. From 2011 -- 2020 I lectured in journalism and media-related courses at a number of London universities teaching both undergraduate and masters students. Prior to teaching, I have worked as a journalist and news producer in both London and New York for a number of years.

I would welcome the opportunity to meet and talk to as many of you as possible. I want to hear about your concerns for the area and what you want to see Labour do. Please feel free to contact me.

Making the best of a community is a team effort. In Sevenoaks that means finding the common ground and a way to make everyone’s lives better.  

I am a Liberal Democrat because I genuinely believe that life is better if we look after each other and value our differences. As your councillor, my job will be to represent everyone and I will. 

I have been to places where that kind of politics has completely broken down; during my military service in Bosnia, Kosovo and Northern Ireland around the millennium, and then in Afghanistan in 2010. 

Politics and politicians generally get bad press but when it is done as I hope to do it, life improves for everyone. 

From war zones to Sevenoaks seems a big leap, but my survey tells me the same story. Help us make a living, give us a good education, promote access to health and social care. 

Most of all I know from those experiences that a community is only as strong as its weakest link. 

A vote for me ON THE 6TH MAY IS A VOTE TO MAKE THE BEST OF  OUR TOWN AND OUR COMMUNITY

OUR ENVIRONMENT We must take action NOW for the sake of future generations. We need: •	Action on single use plastic •	Action to halve the level of pollution in Sevenoaks  •	To be carbon neutral by 2030 •	To make it easier to use electric cars and bikes •	To plant more trees

OUR EDUCATION •	More local school places for local children •	Specialist SEN school places in Sevenoaks so all Sevenoaks children have access to the right school locally  •	Investment in schools that benefit the whole town •	Fix Kent’s poor spending record on education

OUR TRANSPORT •	Fix the pavements, the potholes and unblock the drains •	A Sevenoaks 20 mph zone •	Safe walking and cycling routes  •	A local hop-on electric bus •	Fix bottlenecked junctions where traffic can’t flow and pollution is bad •	An improved joined up transport system for Sevenoaks",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/28416-39cb121d-98f5-4b83-bb92-f502b0d98738.png

I was a university lecturer researching sustainability, and responsible business practice before I became a councillor and was active in several local and citywide voluntary groups, including Sheffield Renewables, an organisation aiming to provide renewable energy for community buildings.

Sheffield is a great place to live but I’m aware that there are many issues in Brightside & Hillsborough constituency that need improvements.

I’m concerned about increasing traffic which pollutes the air we breathe, creates congestion and makes our streets unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists. Linked to this is the lack of affordable public transport in Sheffield. A publicly funded, reliable bus service would provide a sustainable alternative to car use.

I fully support public control of our public services such as the NHS. These are the backbone of society and have the potential to improve the lives of all residents. I also want to see Increases in social housing that will enable more people to live with dignity in housing that meets their needs.

If elected, I will seek to address the needs of local residents and contribute to constituency improvements. But I am also keenly aware of the Climate Crisis and the Biodiversity Crisis and want to make sure that the importance of the natural environment and climate change are factored into every decision. I joined the Green Party because I was concerned about the destruction of our natural environment and the loss of biodiversity in the UK and I am keen to contribute to a more sustainable life for us, our children and future generations.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/50237.png

“I lived locally for nearly 10 years – my children attended Broomhall Children’s Centre and King Edward VII School. I was a secondary school teacher for 16 years and for the past seven years I have worked in the voluntary sector: for five years for a disability charity and for the last two for a homeless charity. I’m also the trustee of a local human rights organisation.

I’m an EU citizen who moved from Italy to Sheffield 26 years ago and have raised my family here. I love how diverse the ward is and I am engaged with many community groups in all parts of the ward: in the nearly four years since being elected, I have supported the volunteer group BBEST to get their Neighbourhood Plan to the referendum stage and finally passed in 2021. I support the Hanover TARA in all their dealings with Sheffield City Council and I was instrumental in the publication of the report about the cladding of the Hanover Tower in 2020. I regularly support litter picks in Broomhill, Broomhall and Hunters Bar as well as attending as many community meetings as I can.

Since being elected in 2019, I have been a member of various SCC committees: Health Scrutiny, Licensing and Audit & Standards. I am particularly interested in governance and finance so I am pleased to still be a member of the Audit & Standards committee. In the municipal year 2021-22, I was the Adviser to the Executive Member for Inclusive Economy and skills, taking particular interest in the skills and adult education side of the portfolio and concentrating on expanding the offer of training for green jobs in Sheffield.

Since May 2022 I have been the Co-chair of the Adult Health & Social Care Policy Committee and a member of the Strategy & Resources Policy Committee. I am also the Deputy Speaker for the Green Group at Sheffield City Council.

As Co-chair of the AHSC Policy Committee, I have set the tone for our work ethics by co-chairing with a Councillor from another group and involving the deputy (from the third group) from the very start. The three groups have been involved in every single decision and we have made every single one by consensus. The AHSC Committee is often used as an example in SCC of how well the committee system can work despite the fact that we had to find the most savings for the 23-24 budget (47% of all SCC savings for the year)!

I am a team player: I work extremely close to my ward colleagues, Brian and Maleiki. We speak to each other virtually daily and meet at least once a week. We share the workload and we always try to do our best to support our constituents.

I also work closely with the whole Green Councillor Group and I am well respected by colleagues in other political groups.

I am very proud of my record as a councillor: I work hard and I am totally committed to the role to ensure that we get the best outcomes for a greener future for the citizens of Sheffield. If elected again I will continue to work hard to ensure that we achieve climate and social justice for our citizens and close the inequality gap in the city.

My final year was spent in a local pupil referral unit where I witnessed the damage done to children’s futures once they have been excluded from school. Many of the youngsters I worked with had struggled in the school system because of unresolved learning difficulties and chaotic home situations. I believe schools must provide not only a rigorous academic curriculum but also one that emphasises personal development. As we recover from the damage wrought by the pandemic, investing in local children and young people will be crucial. This includes working with local sports groups, offering assistance with grants and helping them to flourish.

I am currently an education volunteer at Whirlow Hall Farm Trust and an Independent Visitor for Sheffield City Council.

I strongly support a move away from the ‘Strong Leader’ model for running the Council to a more democratic and transparent committee system in which all councillors have the opportunity to make a difference and reflect the views of their voters.

I am an advocate of free speech and wish to see an end to the current obsession with divisive identity politics and the censorious cancel culture. Free speech encourages healthy debate and we must be willing to listen to the views of others and be receptive to new ideas.

I welcome the concern of many in our city for the future of the planet. However, this must not be an abstract notion expressed only through protest. Practical local everyday actions should be encouraged. Nurturing a love of nature and a commitment to cleaning up our local environment  are simple steps. Encouraging responsible dog ownership, with zero tolerance of fouling and the provision of more bins is also a priority. I will visit local schools to promote the SDP’s ‘Litter Bug’ initiative. I support the work of STAG in their bid to save healthy trees from being unnecessarily replaced.

Hi, I’m Jason and I live in Banner Cross. I’m a father, researcher, and love the outdoors.

As your councillor I would focus on building a green recovery from the pandemic that has affected all of us, and pushed many people into poverty. We need to support our local shops and businesses, encourage people to walk and cycle, and get passengers back on our buses once it is safe to do so. I support the Better Buses campaign which would bring Sheffield’s buses back under public control.

We are lucky to live in one of Sheffield’s cleanest and greenest suburbs and I aim to keep it that way. I will work to protect the character of our area, along with our street trees and open spaces, large and small. Many of us can do more to reduce litter, pollution and congestion – part of building back better is supporting people to make those positive changes.

I’m passionate about democracy and looking for ways that we can all have more of a say about where we live. Sheffield City Council has done excellent work through the pandemic, but it could be more effective.

Using her experience as a former Special Constable, she’s worked with the local Police force to keep our community safe and to tackle the problem of nuisance off-road motorbikes. In July 2017 Louise was appointed Shadow Policing Minister and has campaigned for the Police to be properly resourced, staffed, and accountable to the public.

I grew up in a village in Lincolnshire, but have lived in large cities all over Europe; Birmingham, London, Copenhagen, Milan and Sheffield; it’s a wonderful kind of insight to learn how other people do things, as well as live in both inner cities and rural areas. 

Then there’s my parents’ sense of public duty – as a police officer and health & social care worker – which instilled in me values based on fairness and community care. My work first as an independent theatre-maker, then in academia, and now in the videogames sector running a small business means I understand what it means to be precarious as well as to have the responsibility of others’ livelihoods in my stewardship. 

A common thread through it all though has been activism. After being involved in student and environmental protests in my 20s and working in communities, the arts, and the tech sector trying to advocate for better worlds since, I have been disheartened to see Keir Starmer’s Labour Party give up on workers, the NHS, and the climate emergency. Watering down policies one by one. The refusal to value the lives of Palestinians alongside those of Israeli hostages in November 2023 was a last straw. That’s what brought me to the Green Party.

Both Labour and the Conservatives tell us they see the problems we face, but neither are brave or honest about the solutions. The Green Party is. The Green Party puts people and workers at its heart. Sets out real possibilities to increase wages; lower bills; stimulate the economy through green jobs; and build walkable cities, connecting towns and villages with public transport and infrastructure which improves our lives, our health, and our wellbeing. We need an NHS which is not on its knees, a state which supports us, and success which is shared by all.

I have always believed in worker’s rights, the need for justice for all, to build a society that lifts us all up, and an NHS and state that pick us up when we stumble. I also believe that the most urgent threat to our ability to improve our lives is the climate emergency. This starts with us, at a local level, making changes that work for us, and help us build a better world, together.

If I were elected as MP for Sheffield South East, it would be a privilege to listen to you. To not just advocate for change, but to make it.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/112415/3c02259b-f3f4-4c94-bd89-3a4fc88e4aa4.png

But I also have extensive experience working on nationwide NHS programmes, developing national strategy and policy for the NHS, including secondments working in Whitehall. 

I am determined to overcome the challenges of poor access to services and worse health outcomes faced by everyone living in coastal communities like Sittingbourne and Sheppey. That's a big part of why I'm standing to be your MP.

I have recently moved to Sittingbourne to make my home here. The last few years have been tough for everyone and we need a fresh start in Sittingbourne and Sheppey.

After 14 years in government the Conservatives have delivered nothing but chaos – from Partygate to the Cost-of-Living Crisis, and every other new low point for the country in between.

As your MP, my priorities will be getting the NHS back on its feet, ensuring that people feel safe and secure again and making sure that everyone here sees the benefits of economic stability and growth that a Labour Government will bring.

You need to be able to pay your mortgages and bills rather than worry every month. We all need the NHS to function as well as it did under the last Labour Government. The country needs opportunities and hope for our young people.

Naturally, I was inducted into Saints mania from an early age. “Do and say what you want, but don’t tell your mum!” whispered my uncle as I watched, from the terraces, Richard Hall slam in his first header in a 2-2 away draw with Bolton Wanderers in early 1992. I was instantly hooked. 

Between 2007 and late 2021 I had worked in London, latterly in senior roles overseeing the conduct of business in the financial markets. Building upon these experiences, I founded a consultancy in late 2021. Headquartered near Southampton Airport, this business has rapidly grown to become a trusted adviser to entities in the UK and beyond. 

As a small business owner, the prospect of a Labour government fills me with dread. This shambolic Conservative administration has already made the UK uncompetitive by raising corporation tax on companies with profits over £250k from 19% to 25%. A Labour party addicted to spending other people’s money and interfering would only make matters worse. If they can’t manage the finances at Southampton City Council, then why should we entrust them with running the world’s 6th largest economy? At Reform UK, we are committed to reducing the tax and regulatory burdens on entrepreneurs. We would bin the oppressive IR35 rules on sole traders, lift the VAT threshold to £100k and cut corporation tax to 15% from year five. 

As a father, I abhor the thought of Labour turbo-charging the woke nonsense that has infiltrated our schools. The “Conservative” Party has indulged the proliferation of harmful and divisive race and gender ideologies. Enough. Reform UK would banish both from our education system within 100 days of taking office. 

Finally, as a citizen I believe it is critical that we break the addiction to uncontrolled mass immigration. Since Blair took office in 1997 successive governments, Labour and Conservative, have shown complete contempt for public opinion on this issue. With public infrastructure, housing stock and, in some places, social cohesion under severe strain, reform of our immigration system is now a matter of national security. Reform UK would introduce a selective, skills based, legal entry scheme. Unlike Labour, Reform UK would operate a zero tolerance approach to illegal migration rather than reward it with a de facto amnesty. Equally, Reform UK would seek the immediate deportation of foreign nationals who commit criminal offences here. 

On 4th July the choice doesn’t have to be between failed incumbency and Starmergeddon. Vote Reform UK!",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/75934/9d1c2039-62ff-4edf-b7e5-4a8aee0f72c0.png

My journey to this point has always had Southampton Test at its heart. I first came to Southampton Test aged 18 months having been diagnosed with cerebral palsy and written off. My fightback began with the skill help and support of Southampton General, who have been there every step of the way since. 

“My whole life, professional and personal, has been about overcoming challenges, in environments where failure simply is not an option. I hope to be able to use those attributes in serving and representing the residents of Southampton Test. Together we can ensure bold action provides a Secure future for the City.”

My main aims if elected as MP would be

1.	To ensure the people of Southampton Test feel that their voice is heard and they are represented. With a Labour MP since 1997 and a council on which 70% of the seats are held by Labour there is no check or debate currently. The people deserve an MP who will listen, not just hear, and act accordingly. 

2.	Focus on the things that really matter to people. Continuing to cut crime and antisocial behaviour, cleaning up our streets, further elevating the pride Southampton communities feel in their city. 

3.	Ensure the resilience of infrastructure and industry in the city, making sure the port has the capacity to continue to provide quality jobs for residents for years to come by helping to  attract further investment. As well as making sure our infrastructure and transport network is future proofed so the people and business’ of Southampton Test can plan with confidence and thrive.

Recycling and the Environment As an ex-director of a waste recycling business (sold last year) based in Lancashire, I  would look to use my sustainability, financial and operational leadership in accelerating our council’s zero carbon target to meet the national objective (which is still too little, too late).

Planning and Development It is no secret that Moreton has seen huge development over the last decade or so. Any further development needs to ensure it takes into account the need for the community to be sustainable with jobs and services being provided to avoid it becoming a commuter suburb. Any further development also needs to recognise the importance of Moreton as being in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and must not degrade our surroundings.

Education and Connections Secondary Schools are only viable with pupil numbers of around 1000 so that a full range of subjects, support and resources are available. Moreton would need to expand significantly to warrant a secondary school in the town and I am not advocating it should. Instead, the town needs better provision for teenagers and better, affordable, public transport provision to venues and training opportunities in other areas, notably the south of the county and north into Stratford and Warwick. Whilst neither education nor transport are responsibilities of Cotswold District Council, a strong voice is required to represent the needs of the town in these areas.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/77241/b11b32c7-b847-4007-9062-d6f48fb45ac6.png

I am not a career politician – after my Oxford law degree I worked in business, and earned a doctorate in systems change. But my most unusual achievement is being first woman to row solo across three oceans - Atlantic, Pacific and Indian – to raise awareness of the environmental crisis.

But the environment is not our only crisis. We need truly affordable housing, support for families struggling with everyday bills, and better access to GPs and dentists. We need investment in rural surgeries and local hospitals. We must stop dumping sewage into our rivers, and the overdevelopment of our countryside.

As the daughter of Methodist preachers, I was taught to serve people, respect our environment and maintain high standards of conduct - values we need to restore to public life. 

As your MP, I will listen to you and fight tirelessly for our communities, investment in public services, support for local businesses, and a fairer society with opportunity for all. I have proved I have the perseverance, determination and unwavering commitment an MP needs.

Independent polls show I am in a tight fight with the Conservatives. I humbly ask for your vote, as a fresh and energetic voice who will serve you, your family, and community.

At last, Rishi Sunak has bowed to pressure and called a general election. It is another huge opportunity to remove the out-of-touch Conservatives from our county. We did it just a few weeks ago in the Dorset Council elections which saw voters decide enough is enough and replace the Tories with the new Liberal Democrat leadership. We now hold 42 seats versus just 2 for Labour across Dorset. We are also the real challengers to the Conservatives when you narrow it down to the South Dorset constituency, where we got double the number of seats the Tories did and 5 x more than Labour did. I’m proud to be part of that change. We are the party that listens, that understands the issues, and that acts. It’s time for me to ask for your support to elect me as your local champion.

I’m no career politician, parachuted in from North London, nor have I skulked around the fringes of the inept Tory administration for the last 14 years, who’s general ineptitude and lack of empathy has made much of the population worse off. I want to champion the needs of the community in which I grew up, live, teach and raise my family. I fight for the needs of Dorset people every day as a councillor and activist on issues such as flooding, car parking, homes and pharmacies. I want to continue to provide South Dorset with a listening ear and a strong voice, but this time in Westminster!

Every vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote for a fair deal. By electing a Liberal Democrat MP you will have a local representative who is committed to working hard to create a fair, prosperous and innovative economy that promotes opportunity and wellbeing. A Lib Dem MP will seek to provide fair access to good public services and a strong social safety net. A Lib Dem MP will strive to establish a flourishing environment with fair access to nature for all. The Liberal Democrats will forge a strong United Kingdom within a fair international order. At the very heart of all Liberal Democrats is the belief that we need a truly fair democracy, where everyone’s rights are respected, and individuals and communities are empowered.

I intend to be an influential MP on behalf of residents across South Dorset. I’m a teacher and parent who understands how the conservative government has failed families and educators. I’m a campaigner who has seen how our government failed to act meaningfully on issues like flooding and sewage in our sea. I’m a local councillor who knows our conservative MP actually voted against more funding for our council to spend on our communities.

It's time! In July you will get the chance to vote to get rid of this out-of-touch Conservative government. Based on the recent local elections, and the significant groundswell of support the Liberal Democrats received, this should be a race between us and the Conservatives. It's time to change the system and give people real hope. It's time to deliver the fair deal the British people deserve.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/116435/47937e17-899e-4a12-9fe5-995bb6ce4b79.png

I absolutely love my work but I know that the best way to make the biggest difference is with a Labour government.



I am not from a typical political family. My dad left school at 15 to train to be an electrician. Encouraged by my mum, a primary school teacher, he later went back into further education and spent his career helping others to do the same. This shaped my passion for removing the barriers to opportunity so we can all get on and build a better future. I want there to be no barriers to limit the ambitions of children in each and every one of our classrooms across South East Cornwall.



Recently I spent several years caring for a family member throughout a long illness, feeling like we were trying to move mountains the entire time when all we were trying to do was get the care we needed. It was clear that our NHS is on its knees but I know it doesn't have to be like this and I will be a fierce advocate for improvements to healthcare provision.



As an economic development professional I have worked to deliver change from Westminster to the UN and I will use my experience to deliver positive results for our communities. I will campaign hard to ensure that this beautiful part of the world benefits from improvements to public services and is positioned to take advantage of future economic opportunities within a strong national and local economy that works for working people.



I pledge to improve the lives of people in South East Cornwall by;

Tackling the serious shortage of NHS doctors and nurses at Treliske and Derriford by closing tax loopholes and using the money to train thousands more doctors, nurses and urgently needed NHS dentists.

Fixing South East Cornwall's Housing Crisis by building genuinely affordable homes with prices linked to local wages, banning no-fault evictions for renters and disincentivizing second homes.

End the cost of living crisis by reducing energy bills with a proper windfall tax on the huge profits of oil and gas companies and giving people more security at work by banning zero hour contracts.

Boost the local economy by taking advantage of new opportunities in industries such as Cornish renewable energy to develop skills, apprenticeships and good jobs here at home.

Protect our environment by setting up the publicly owned GB Energy, investing in green industry and cleaning up our beaches with a legally binding end to sewage discharges by 2030 and personal fines for water bosses who break these rules.

The subject of LTNs has been, by far, the most talked-about issue on the doorstep. It’s time for the council to accept that, in practice, the Palmers Green and Bowes Park LTNS have not worked and to acknowledge the negative impact they are having on surrounding areas, such as the Highfield ward. As your Liberal Democrat councillor, I would oppose the installation of any LTNS in the ward and campaign for the removal of those in place in the surrounding areas.

Born, bred, brought up and educated in the UK. I have worked and visited in all but one continent. I was state-educated.

I have lived in this constituency since 1987 – I am not a candidate parachuted in! I have always been concerned about this area and its people. 

I have been a town councillor, the mayor, and a trustee of several local charities. I have volunteered and helped on several occasions for various community projects. 

I was an ardent independent, but Reform does not dictate their policies to representatives if the policy does not benefit their constituency.

I believe in:

Drain the Swamp, not the People.

Support the country you live in – or – live in the country you support.

Don’t judge people by what group they’re in – but by their individual actions and words.

My other concerns include how the governments have let us down – the people.

Governments for decades have let us down.

The Tories Broke Britain - Labour will bankrupt Britain - Only Reform UK can Save Britain.

The one thing that I feel the various governments have really let us down is trust. Our armed services lay down their lives for ‘King and Country’.

Some of them then get prosecuted for their actions whilst in uniform. For example, Kier Starmer prosecuted Soldiers for a false claim of brutality in Iraq.

The government repays those brave people who have poorly maintained married quarters. And a lack of support for our retired veterans.

Last year, the number of homeless veterans rose by 14%; nearly ½ of them slept on the streets. (the rest in shelters).

I think it’s time for the government to look after our troops.

Whilst serving their welfare and for their lawful actions whilst serving and not protecting those who acted against our troops.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/551598184fb3d15c51926dca.png

He has been involved in local campaigns and representing his local community for over 20 years.

Chris serves as a primary school governor and is a trustee of a local homelessness charity, so he takes a special interest in education issues and is keenly aware of housing and homelessness problems. 

Professionally, he is a Chartered Public Relations Practitioner specialising in community engagement. He has a Masters degree in business (MBA), runs his own business and is a member of the Norfolk Chamber of Commerce.

Chris will bring his experience and knowledge from business and voluntary work to campaign for better housing, more funding for our schools and colleges, improved transport links, support for local businesses and rural communities, and crucially action to tackle the climate emergency. 

The environment is now his biggest concern, and he recently marched with his sons on the Norwich Climate Strike, recognising the urgent and huge challenge of our climate crisis. He also recently met with the Norfolk NFU representative to understand the challenges for our farming and agriculture sector, especially relating to Brexit.

Chris has always believed that our nation is stronger and more prosperous within Europe. He wants the next generation to have the opportunities that he had and to be able to live, travel, work, love and study without hindrance across the EU.

Another amazing result in 2023 saw her elected as the first ever Green Party County Councillor elected in the formerly Tory heartlands of rural South Norfolk. In West Depwade the Greens went from last place to first in just one year. The success was repeated in 2024 when the Green Party won the by election for a district Council seat in the same division. Before and after her time in the European Parliament, Catherine was a professor of philosophy at the University of East Anglia. She is deputy coordinator of the Eastern Region Green Party and the party's national spokesperson on issues relating to employment, work and social security. Catherine has previously stood as the parliamentary candidate for South Norfolk in 2015 and 2017. L

In launching her campaign in South Norfolk this year, Catherine said:

""Now more than ever South Norfolk needs the opportunity to vote Green, to deliver the action that we need in the face of multiple threats to rural livelihoods, natural habitats, quiet lanes and dark skies. Nationally we need to prioritise policies that enable people and businesses to thrive, restoring hope and health. Decades of Tory austerity and corruption have made us one of the most miserable countries in the world, with children going hungry and old people unable to get out and about. These are political choices. Greens would prioritise fairness over cruelty. It's that simple. We need to change the system from the bottom to the top, in finance, economy, housing, energy, transport and wage structures. We need committed Green politicians in government. We need a clear message to all politicians that what matters to us above all else is the urgent elimination of all our projects and practices that amount to destructive exploitation of our planet. If we don't say that now, we shall be too late.

The Green party has been preparing a blueprint for a better society for years. It will be a society that sits lightly on its natural home and cares for the woodlands and the bees, the birds, the badgers and the hedgehogs. No other party is so well placed to address the problem, and if you and other Norwich voters continue to suppress that option behind tactical voting for the same old stuff all over again, there will be no future for us or for our children.

All our funding comes from people like you, who desperately want to see that new vision enacted and are prepared to send money to see it happen. So we don't have to slow the pace of change because of the pressure from donors whose vested interests are in the old destructive way of doing things. And we have no difficulty with explaining why we absolutely need to stay in the European Union, even though the European Union is not perfect. It too needs our voice at the table to get a faster pace of change for the better there as well.

For every Green vote cast in South Norfolk, a small amount of ""short money"" will go to those Green Party MPs whom we successfully elect to Westminster across the country this time. This ""short money"" is there to help them to represent your views, even if you are not in one of the lucky constituencies that wins a Green MP. So no Green vote is a wasted vote. It also sends a message about which party you trust to look after the interests of future generations.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/5998/8a7924d3-3600-41e4-860a-ae675d7832c6.png

After leaving school I joined the Youth Training Scheme (YTS) my first job was working for the Chief Executive of Northampton Borough Council. For the next twenty years I worked in the statutory and voluntary sector in social care and health advocated for people living in deprived areas of the town, until I decided to become a Social Worker. I joined the Labour Party and have been Labour Councillor for past 10 years and proud to say I was former Mayor of Northampton. I am proud mother to three wonderful children and crazy about our cats Tibby, Sapphire, and Simba. I am also Foster Carer and care for my son with Acquired Brain Injury.



I am a community activist, passionate about the environment and delivered many campaigns including climate change. I also sit on the board of Trustee at Northampton Domestic Abuse Service, and advocate for women and men facing abuse. I am the founder of Northants Fibromyalgia Support Group. I have volunteered at foodbank, youth club, Women's group, home-start and as family support worker. I have many years of experience campaigning on the doorstep, attended conference as delegate, elected as National Policy Forum representative, was elected as Chair of Northampton Labour Group, elected as BAME and Women's Officer. Housing has been another concern to me ever since Unitary, I have been concerned about rural social isolation, lack of SEN provision, condition of our roads and lack of infrastructure. Few years ago, I worked for Northamptonshire Acre, I visited villages were people told me they felt isolated from everyone and had no local services therefore the information we shared with them really made a difference as many faced rural poverty and felt it was the only time they saw anyone.



I will be an accessible MP, someone people can relate too. I am in touch with local people and listen to their concerns. I want a more inclusive society where everyone is treated equally with respect. I will fight to bring change in rural areas, encourage people not to isolate themselves but instead fight together to receive accessible service, champion climate change, offer better transport service, youth provision, bring back life where they live.

During my career in child protection social work, I saw first-hand the harsh realities of frontline social work and the detrimental effect of poverty, especially in the North East.

Now, as an MP, I work consistently day in, day out, for the people of South Shields supporting local charities and organisations, providing advice and support to constituents, tackling both national and local issues and aiding funding bids to secure new opportunities for our area.

I have been an effective and strong voice in Parliament on matters such as free school meals and breakfasts for children, support for victims, sewage pollution, poverty, children's services, the cost-of-living crisis and levelling up promises. I regularly speak up on a range of local issues including workers rights, against the cuts to South Tyneside Hospital, funding for South Shields, transport links and support for local businesses.

In Parliament, I sit on the Defence Select Committee and the Committee on Arms Export Controls to scrutinise Government actions. I work hard as the Co-Chair of the Child of the North APPG, aiming to improve the lives of children in the North and tackle regional disparities, alongside being a member of several other APPGs.

I keep constituents updated on my work through my social media and regular newsletters alongside speaking to many thousands of constituents through door knocking, surgeries, drop-ins and special events for both the public and for Labour members all year round.

South Shields, and the rest of our country, desperately need a Labour Government and I will work tirelessly to ensure that happens.

He now pioneers new technology in the security industry in the West Midlands.

Whilst serving in the Army aged only 17, Stuart suffered a high-velocity gunshot wound to the foot. He was initially told his foot and possibly his lower leg would be amputated, but the weeks of surgery went better than expected and his leg was saved. He was then informed that his military career was over, he would never run again and would only ever walk with the aid of a walking stick. 

Stuart didn’t accept this and undertook extensive rehabilitation and within one year, through relentless pain, determination and hard work returned to full service within the Army, going straight to active duty on the streets of Northern Ireland. He went on to complete eight years in the Royal Green Jackets (now the Rifles), including three operational tours undertaking some of the toughest physical challenges in the world. Stuart has had the privilege of getting to share his remarkable story as a guest speaker at events and even on national television.

After leaving the Forces, Stuart worked in the defence and security industry, operating in over 50 locations around the globe. He has briefed heads of the military and operated as a bodyguard for a foreign Prime Minister. He is currently the founder and CEO of a multi award winning company, using this experience to pioneer technology to help companies keep employees safe when travelling. 

For over 15 years Stuart served in the local community, and different charities, from fundraising for underprivileged children, to serving at homeless shelters. A key highlight has been serving as a military champion and helping those who have given so much. 

Stuart also ran 79 miles in under 24 hours over every mountain in South Wales. Raising money for a minibus for underprivileged children in Herefordshire. This was after he was told that he would never run again after getting shot. 

Stuart has witnessed many different political situations around the world, from western democracy to the streets of Baghdad. This has all helped shape his desire to enter the political arena. Stuart was elected a County Councillor in 2017 gaining a large majority in a seat never previously held by the Conservatives. His wealth of experience makes him an excellent candidate to serve the residents of Wolverhampton South West.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/35364.png

Matthew Green is the only person to have beaten the Conservatives here at a General Election – and he’s ready to beat them again.

“When Chris Naylor sadly had to, for health reasons, step back from being the Lib Dem candidate, many people asked me to put myself forward. They did so because they know I am the best chance of ensuring that South Shropshire does not return a Tory MP, as I am the only person to have beaten the Tories here at a General Election,” said Matthew.

He added, “From conversations with local residents on doorsteps over the past couple of years, it has become clear that the overwhelming mood of the electorate is to see this shameful Conservative Government removed from office.”",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/115595/cb53a2ab-e058-4e77-8762-52e022bc9fd7.png

Born in Plymouth’s Freedom Fields Hospital, I grew up locally and attended Plymouth High School for Girls. My parents ran a small design and build kitchen company and modelled the values of hard work, commitment and dedication to our local community. Growing up through the Recessions of the 1980s and 90s also meant we didn’t have a lot of spare money, so I know what it’s like when ends are hard to meet. 

After graduating from the University of Southampton with a degree in Modern History and Politics, I worked in Brussels and then came home and worked in Plymouth City Council’s Homelessness team before moving to London. For the following eleven years, I worked in public service in London in a range of roles including on criminal justice policy as part of the Shadow Justice team in the run up to the 2010 General Election. However, throughout this time, I worked with one aim in mind – to return home and fight Plymouth and Devon’s corner, getting the best deal for our communities.

And that’s what I’ve been doing since returning home in 2015. I have been a Councillor representing Plymstock Radford since 2018, have served as Chair of the Planning Committee, Cabinet Member for Homes and Communities and had the privilege of leading The Commission on Violence against Women and Girls. I also work part time for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission doing public engagement across the South West, and for Sir Gary Streeter MP on a range of projects, gaining extensive knowledge of the South West Devon constituency.

In December 2019, I stood as Parliamentary Candidate for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, having campaigned since November 2018. I regularly speak to community groups about my work for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, my role as a Councillor and Cabinet Member and the work we have done on Violence against Women and Girls. 

In May 2023, I was selected as Prospective Member of Parliament for South West Devon ahead of the next General Election.

I am a member of the Conservative Friends of the Armed Forces, Conservative Environment Network, Conservative Rural Forum and the Conservative Christian Fellowship. 

You will often find me out walking in the Devon countryside or cooking for friends and family. I am an avid Formula One fan, attend a local church and enjoy doing the Park Run in Plymbridge Woods (occasionally!). I also enjoy reading and spending time in my garden.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/17695/18362398-2f81-416d-9e53-e0498630882b.png

I believe I can offer that focus, support and dedication and that is why I have put myself forward to be a candidate.



I've lived in South West Norfolk my whole life and my family are rooted across the constituency. I'm passionate about our shared community. It is where I call home and it is the reason I first entered politics.



I was born and brought up in Thetford and, once through the local education system, I intended to become a teacher but then became involved in my local community and was elected to Thetford Town Council in 2008 aged 22. I later joined both Breckland Council and Norfolk County Council.



I've served on all three levels of local governments for more than ten years and understand well the many complexities and frustrations that come from our different tiers of Government.



At Breckland I served as the Leader of the Opposition for 10 years, standing down in 2023 to allow time to focus on my new role as Vice Chairman of the Council and Chairman of the Council's Scrutiny Commission -- an important part of the Council's governance structure, holding the executive to account.



Politics for me is about being able to help people, solve problems and bring people together through hard work and co-operation. I would like to think I have built a reputation for getting things done as a local Councillor and I use my skills and experience to benefit the area I serve and the people within it. I have been delighted to be re-elected on multiple occasions, always improving on my previous election result.



Aside from my role as a local Councillor I run my own business -- producing a monthly magazine that is distributed to 13,000 homes locally. I work with more than eighty small businesses every month and understand the challenges they face.



Small and medium enterprises are crucial to both our local economy and our communities -- inflation and the cost of living crisis have made trading difficult for many businesses, as well as our residents.



I am involved in numerous local charitable groups including the Charles Burrell Centre in Thetford where I serve as Chair of the Board of Directors. This is a role I have undertaken since its inception back in 2012. The CBC has progressed from nothing more than a shell, into a thriving community and business centre with an annual turnover of nearly half a million pounds.

This period highlighted a stark contrast: while some areas thrived, many communities were left neglected and broken. The last Conservative government fostered an unequal society, and today, under the current Conservative administration, our society has become even more unequal, unhealthy, poorer, and unsafe.   In 2014, motivated by the struggles I saw around me, I entered local politics under yet another Conservative government. Becoming a politician wasn’t my lifelong ambition, but I could no longer stand by as my neighbours struggled to make ends meet, young people were drawn into crime, unemployment rose, and essential services like the NHS and Social Care faced severe cuts. Rising living costs and growing inequality spurred me into action. It's evident that we need change.   Throughout my life, I have stood up for fairness and have a proven track record of getting things done. As a councillor and cabinet lead for health and wellbeing, I’ve tackled these challenges head-on, fighting to improve services and support for residents. From housing to climate change, I’ve listened to residents’ concerns and am committed to addressing them.   Many people in South West Wiltshire don’t feel better off after fourteen years of Conservative rule. With Labour, we have a real chance to transform our community: revitalizing our high streets, addressing antisocial behaviour, and investing in essential health services and our environment.   Coming from a military family, I understand the importance of security and the sacrifices made by those who serve our country. As your representative, I will be a strong voice for our community’s military personnel, advocating for the support and resources they deserve.   If elected, I will be accessible and accountable to residents, committed to working alongside community groups, businesses, and charities to shape our area for the better. With your support, we can ensure that South West Wiltshire thrives under a progressive Labour government with a dedicated Labour MP.   Only the Labour Party can beat the Tories in South West Wiltshire and bring about the transformation we desperately need.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/47313/ada8eda2-3d05-4eae-b00c-1edbfd57ce16.png

When my employer ripped up my contract after 25 years of loyal service at Heathrow Airport , my colleagues and I (all Spelthorne residents) asked our MP for help, but he did not want to know. On top of this, I was a victim of three serious crimes, experienced rogue landlords - the list goes on. In hindsight, it was a blessing in disguise. I was a political innocent at the time of Brexit. Like many others I foolishly believed all the lies we were fed. I then realised that the Liberal Democrats had been telling the truth all along. Against the odds, we have won the County and Borough elections within 18 months. Since then by working together, we have solved so many longstanding issues whilst creating endless opportunities. Now is our opportunity to take this to the next level and get the best for Spelthorne. A constituency which has been neglected and where our elected MP has never wanted to reside or connect with.  I love Spelthorne and my neighbours; it’s our home, and we have a real chance to change things for the better. Unfortunately, unlike the big parties, we don’t have the available funds but we do have the will!  During the next six weeks, if you can help  ‘Team Spelthorne’ in any way - big or small - please direct message me. We have a track record of getting things done and as I’m not particularly liked by our opponents, it’s clear we are definitely doing something right!

I am a professional chartered engineer of 21 years born in Halifax, live within Spen Valley, having spent a lifetime here, connected through the family.

I am compelled to stand for my home seat of Spen Valley because, as a mother, a wife, and a citizen of this country, I am deeply concerned with the direction those in power are taking this nation I love. This is being felt by me at both a National and Local Level and now pervades every area of my life.

I went from being apathetic about politics to deeply caring about the future of my son’s life in our once amazing Country.

I could not, with all integrity, sit back and watch the shocking disassembly of democratic systems, which I once took for granted, accompanied by the unashamed mass removal of our freedoms.

Everything Now Feels Like One Constant Battle: A fight to get a GP appointment A struggle to get a flight on holiday because of the EU Net Zero Caps A challenge to speak to anyone human to access basic services within 2 hours A confrontation at schools to ensure the safeguarding of my son during his education A grapple with people in positions of medical power to ensure sovereignty over my own body A scrap concerning freedom of movement in my own neighbourhood, let alone in the EU A wrestle with my bank about when and how I may withdraw my money A fracas with the public sector referees who are supposed to be upholding my rights against the behemoth of big business; or a skirmish with employers who seek to steamroller my liberties; And a battle royale for things that we’ve fought and won already, which should have been nailed in their coffins long ago, like Brexit and the deliberate state of our porous borders. In fact, as I say these words, it feels less like a battle and more like – controlled demolition.

I bring my honesty, skill, technical experience, leadership, clarity, compassion, and resourcefulness into the constituency I now live in with my husband, where we raise our child alongside yours.

I offer my services to you to uphold your values and add them to our fight. I’m aligned with the principles and values of the Reform UK Party, having evolved from the Brexit Party, whom I stood for in my birth constituency of Halifax in the General Election of 2019.

I know already from speaking to many people in the constituency, that I am also aligned with YOUR values and beliefs, dearly held in Spen Valley.

There is much placed upon politicians for the state of the nation. Blame, grievance , and resentment. I agree that there are many corrupt holders of public office who sorely need to be held to account. Let’s do that!

However, I share with you an additional important view:

If the power is with the people, then so, too, is accountability. A lack of care for the slipping standards is for the people and only the people to account for.

For too long, we have given our power away. And THIS is why I stand. I’m taking back my power to make the change I want! I need your help.

Will you stand with me? Will you take your power back? I’m building a team as I write. It’s the only way. And the time is NOW.”

More Personal Details:

I am 46 years old, and I live in Spen Valley, West Yorkshire, with my husband and son. My early career began when I entered R.A.F Pilot Training whilst reading Aeronautical Engineering at Salford University.

Later, pursuing Engineering around the globe with Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd, BMW Group, Rolls Royce plc, and Jaguar Landrover.

After 14 years, I took a career break when I worked with young boys in West Yorkshire with Emotional, Social, and Mental Health Challenges. I then became a professional musician and toured the world.

Upon returning to Yorkshire, I qualified as a Secondary School Teacher of Engineering Design & Technology at Sheffield Hallam University.

I hold a keen interest in supporting boys to thrive in a world which increasingly holds oppression toward men.

I speak three European Languages and am schooled in Classical Guitar. I regard people and the arts as the “Energy of Life.”

After a life spent away from home and having returned to my roots. I spend as much time as possible in ”Cleckheaton, Huddersfield, and Halifax with my family and friends.

I am proud to be able to follow in the footsteps of Granddad Albert, who was a Justice of the Peace in Halifax in the 1960s.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/71466-b8158cfb-4db3-4ba8-9747-84c2d36faef0.png

I’ve been a Green Party councillor in St Albans since 2011, re-elected 5 times. I'm now the leader of our group of 3 Greens. As a councillor I’ve notched up dozens of achievements, from solar panels on leisure centres to blue badge parking at the train station. Working with others, I’ve hugely raised the profile of environmental and sustainability issues in the council and in our district. I have played a key role in developing the council's response to the climate emergency.

Greens are aiming to stand in every constituency. That way, people can vote for our urgent policies to address the climate emergency and social injustice.

Climate change is the biggest challenge we’ve ever faced. If we don't fix it, we face unimaginable consequences. We CAN fix it, but we need to be bold and fast. We need system change, at national government level.

The good news is that much of this change will make our lives better immediately, not just in the long term. Warm homes, green jobs, clean energy, less polluted streets, cheap and effective public transport. Everybody wants these things, and everybody benefits.

We also need to fix our crumbling, desperately unequal society. We need publicly-owned utilities, as shorter working week, free public childcare and an end to tuition fees. 

If you like these ideas, please vote for them. Every Green vote on 4 July makes it more likely that we’ll achieve them.

I made Stevenage my home, because like many others, I know it's a town that was built on rewarding aspiration and hard work.

But whilst you are working hard, your Conservative MP has been sitting idly by. Out of touch, lost his touch, won't get in touch.

Using my decade of experience as a councillor and armed forces champion, I want to serve you as a full-time MP.

I'm asking residents, whoever they've supported before, to look at how we've been held back by 14 years on chaotic Conservative governments and lend me your support to help unlock the ambitions of our town again -- as a Labour government did when it built Stevenage as one of the first pioneering new towns post WW2.

This year, you will have that chance to vote for real change. To vote to get our future back.

In the meantime, I'm keen to listen to you and focus on your priorities. Here are the missions I've set out so far for our town and villages:

TACKLE THE COST OF LIVING CRISIS

Labour will create publicly owned 'GB energy' to drive down bills, require lenders to provide mortgage support and secure the highest sustained growth in the G7

BUILD AN NHS FIT FOR THE FUTURE

Labour will cut waiting lists by doubling medical school places, recruiting 10,000 new nurses and midwives annually, paid for by scrapping the non-dom tax status

CUT CRIME IN OUR COMMUNITY

Labour will recruit 13,000 new police officers and impose tougher sentences to halve violent crime and tackle anti-social behaviour in Stevenage and the villages

TRANSFORM LOCAL TRANSPORT

Labour will hand powers to local authorities to determine new bus routes and set affordable fares, whilst investing in pothole repairs to fix our broken roads

FIX OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM

Labour will drive up school standards, introduce free breakfast clubs, reform the apprenticeship levy and recruit thousands more well paid teachers

But it's not just the policy that matters, the kind of MP I want to be matters to. I'm making the following personal commitments to every resident:

I will always **live locally**

I'm proud to live in Stevenage and will always live locally. This is my home.

I will be a **full-time MP**

I want to serve residents as a full-time MP, meaning I'd never take a second job.

I will put our **community first**

I will always shop local and will visit as many local schools and businesses as possible in my first term.

I will make **parliament for people**

I will invite decision makers to our community and set up a school trips to parliament scheme.

I will get your **casework completed**

I will ensure I have a hardworking team of staff to help me complete casework, hold surgeries and attend local events

I went to local schools but like so many people across our constituency, I went to work as soon as I was old enough because my family simply couldn’t afford for me to stay on.

For most of my adult life I worked at Pilkingtons which is where I joined a trade union, I helped to set up my branch and became a shop steward. Representing working people there is what led me to the Labour Party and to eventually becoming a Councillor, for my local area. Then came the election in 1979.

When Thatcher came to power, I had just become a councillor. I saw how the decisions of people in Westminster impacted on our communities. I saw poverty and experienced it myself.  I collected food for families who couldn’t put dinner on the table and did everything I could to help people get by when the government told us to ‘try harder’ and ‘help ourselves’ when there were simply no jobs to go to.

I see the exact same thing happening today. I will not stand on the side lines and watch, I will work hard for the people of St Helens South and Whiston.

I’ve served our local area for over thirty years. I’ve been a councillor, Cabinet member and led our council for almost 20 years. I brought millions of pounds of investment and jobs to our area, fought to get two new Hospitals here and then to stop the Burns unit from closing down. It was under my Leadership that we donated land to ensure that Willowbrook Hospice could come into being and for my beloved Saints, I fought time and again to ensure our team got a brand new stadium.

St Helens and Whiston is my home, in 30 years of service I've shown exactly how I can practically deliver for people here, one thing is for certain, I will always be ready to stand up and fight for our constituency and I will always be your voice in Westminster, not Westminster’s voice to you.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/553be49ca51642637514d64a.png

Politics is local, and the people of Stirling deserve a strong voice to make sure they have the best representation in Westminster and beyond. Yes, we need to promote Scotland on the global stage, but we also have to make sure that your MP is there for you when you need them.

Stirling has become a hotbed of Brexit resistance, with Stirling For Europe out and about most weeks working with all parties (and none). There was a massive vote to remain – 67.7% – and I can speak to that audience. Equally, we should be mindful of the independence vote in 2014, where Stirling voted 59.8% No. There’s a respectful dialogue to be had there to reassure and win people over, to make sure that they see independence not as a threat but as an opportunity to build the sort of city, region and nation we want to be.

His mission is to promote Green policies on ‘destruction of the natural environment and our far-reaching policies for ecological sustainability.’

Local farmer Ian knows the ins and outs of the election business, having stood several times as a General and European election candidate during 40 years of active Party membership. Green through and through, Ian has worked in renewables, energy conservation and sustainable farming, and has been director of West Cornwall Community Power. Ian is well-placed to explain to voters how practical solutions, which we already have available, now desperately need to be pursued with vigour and determination.

“Humanity is clearly drinking in last-chance saloon,” Ian reminds us, “and yet mainstream politicians continue to regard this major threat as a mere side issue.”

Ian is also keen to promote the Party’s critique of economic growth and Gross Domestic Product as the sole measure of well-being; to argue for a society which aims to meet people’s needs rather than fuelling people’s greed; and to put the case for sustainable food production as an alternative to the current destructive agricultural practices.

“At a time when so much concerted global action is needed, I despair that the UK has chosen to leave the European Union,” Ian adds. “But above all, I believe that voters must have the choice to vote for an ecologically sustainable future”.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/29511-3ce080de-7090-4295-8ba4-647e8da4dd7a.png

I hope to make my voice heard for young people in this country who have been continuously let down by the past 14 years of Tory rule. In my lifetime, inequality has increased, hate crime has risen and the gender pay gap has stagnated. The Tory rhetoric I grew up surrounded by; ‘hard work equals success’, is a lie. The Green Party, in contrast, understands that we are not born equal and that there are deeply entrenched systems in place that ensure this stays that way. I am standing in the general election to be a voice for change, to break down these systems, in order that everyone in this country benefits.

I am deeply connected to Cambridgeshire; I was born in Addenbrookes, studied at Impington Village College, Hills Road Sixth Form and Cambridge University, before working locally as a landscape designer. During the pandemic I volunteered as the coordinator for Cambridge Community Kitchen, which served 300+ people hot meals 3 times a week. Cambridgeshire is the most unequal place in the UK. If elected, I would make sure all development is sustainable and that we also invest in existing communities. It is imperative that all housing developments should positively impact the residents around them and the landscapes they sit within. East West Rail should be a fully electrified light rail service that takes people where they want to go and should integrate within a rejuvenated, reliable nationalised bus service. 

I am a proud feminist and will always vote on the side of women’s autonomy over their own bodies. I am an LGBTQAI+ ally and am especially passionate about protecting the trans community against violence. I will fight for the rights of minorities and those who suffer under discrimination. I am an antiracist and continue to educate myself around racial discrimination. I stay informed on difficulties facing the disabled community and care greatly about accessibility.

""I'm ambitious about the future for Stockton. We can make this one of the best places in the country to live, work and bring up a family.""



Crime -- I commit to town centre police patrols, tackling gangs, drug dealers and fly tippers. Nationally, we will recruit 13,000 more police and PCSOs, putting more police on the beat across Stockton.



Cost of Living - We will set up a national energy provider that will cut your bills. I will bring new jobs, making Stockton a centre for health and medicines and Billingham a centre for green energy.



Health - I will fight for our local hospital and tackle our high levels of child poverty and poor health. We will rebuild the NHS, bring back the family doctor, deliver two million more hospital appointments and 700,000 more dental appointments.



As Stockton North's Labour MP, I will put our country first and support our armed forces and veterans. I will stand up for Stockton North so that our voice is heard in Westminster.

The two mainstream parties are indistinguishable in their commitment to wars, austerity, corruption and entitlement to power.

I believe in the sanctity of life, values of justice, equality and dignity. We have been forgotten and left behind here in Stoke-on-Trent Central and deserve a better representative who is sincere and capable. My concerns are crime and drug dealing, education, a decimated town centre partially derelict, the NHS, poor infrastructure and roads. Born and bred in Stoke I am proud to be an integral part of the community.

I have seen real leadership in action in my Grandparents, (Master Muhammad Akram and Khurshid Begum (Beji)), may god have mercy on them. Their humble servant leadership was selfless, principled, compassionate, generous, accountable, transparent and honest.

I have spent the last 15 years as a pharmacist looking after the community in Shelton and Hanley. With your prayers and support we have become a great success story. I am a graduate trainer and encourage children into healthcare roles. I am heavily involved in charities and humanitarian work both locally and internationally. I enjoy coaching cricket as a volunteer.

Nowhere is the link between corruption and cruelty more clear than in the ongoing genocide in Gaza. I join people of conscience who are sensible and fair in calling for an end to the genocide and occupation of the Palestinian people.

The people of Stoke-on-Trent Central have a rare opportunity. A vote for Labour or Conservative is a vote for the status quo and politics as usual that has dominated our lives for the past 14 years.

What we do with our vote can help change our future and our children’s future for the better, we will show that we can build a new kind of political life.

I've lived, breathed and loved our area my whole life. My mum and my grandad worked in the Potbanks of Tunstall and Burslem. As a kid, after mass on Sunday I played in our local parks.



In the early days of Labour's flagship Sure Start Centres, I developed programmes to help lift families out of poverty and to give our children the best start in life. I then moved in the voluntary sector, working as Business Development Director for a Queen's Award-winning local charity.



For nearly twenty years, I've brought millions of pounds of funding to our local area. I've created award-winning employment schemes. I've worked to address homelessness. I've worked to tackle food poverty and holiday hunger. I've helped to set up affordable housing for young workers with capped rents and bills. I've secured funding to set up new clubs for young people which had been closed by the Conservatives.



After years of austerity, though, through my work I see first-hand, day in, day out the impact this has had on our area and our proud communities.



Services we all rely on have been cut to the bone. A Conservative cost-of-living crisis has seen our heating bills, food prices, rents and mortgages soar. Residents are waiting longer and longer for operations. Families are unable to register with dentists. Our social care system is in meltdown.



Whilst I love my job, I know that the biggest difference to our community will come about once the Labour Party is in government. That's what has brought me from my community work and into politics.



I promise that I will fight for you and your family, and I hope you can offer me your support so that we can work together to make Stoke-on-Trent and Kidsgrove a better place for each and every one of us.

I've been a Labour Party member for 7 years and I'm passionate about my community and demonstrating how Labour can do things differently.



I became involved in politics because I did not feel represented by those in power and wanted to make a difference in my community. I was frustrated by the deterioration of public services and the widening gap in inequality and opportunity. I realised the only way to make tangible change happen was to be the change I wanted to see, and the Labour Party gave me that opportunity.

I am in my second year as Councillor for Wollaston and Stourbridge Town, having contested the seat three times and finally won a seat back from the Conservatives after 12 years. I helped elect a second Labour Councillor in my ward and we are set to take all 3 seats at the next local election.



I have a proven record of standing up for Stourbridge and working hard to deal with issues and make this a better place to live for everyone. I have established relationships with local stakeholders and work alongside them to achieve positive outcomes. I am a Senior Operating Department Practitioner in the NHS and I've witnessed first-hand the devastation this government has had on our NHS, as well as the police, economy, housing, environment and more.



I want to be the voice of Stourbridge in Parliament and bring about the changes that are desperately needed after years of Conservative rule and austerity. Stourbridge deserves to be represented by a local person who knows the area, the community and what matters to them. I am well known across Stourbridge for being someone who gets things done and listens to concerns, and I've achieved a lot for my ward in my 2 years as Councillor.



I want to take that commitment to the next level and influence how we rebuild Britain and our local areas. I would draw on my political and work experience to work collaboratively with the Council, key stakeholders and trade unions and create a future for Stourbridge where everyone is valued and the area can thrive. Stourbridge needs an MP who can hold the most powerful to account and ensure our policies have a positive impact on the communities we serve.



I have an excellent relationship with party members having been Vice Chair and Chair of the constituency, and always involve our members in campaigns. I've worked hard to mobilise members, deliver training, and spot future talent for the party. Involving members in this way strengthens the party and encourages them to come on this journey with me.



I believe I meet all the criteria and I'm committed to making Stourbridge and the UK a fairer, greener, and more tolerant place to live. It would be the honour of my life to represent my hometown in Westminster and deliver on Labour's vision for a better Britain.

He is originally from Edinburgh and studied Business Studies at Edinburgh Napier University before becoming a professional actor.

In 2009, Scott became a founding member of Sustainable Streatham. The group works to make the local area a safer, fairer, cleaner, greener place to live and work. He was also on the board of Streatham Action, the umbrella body for community groups in Streatham.

Scott was first elected to represent St Leonard’s Ward as the only green councillor to Lambeth Council in 2014. He was then re-elected in 2018 with an increased majority and proud to replace the Conservatives as the main opposition on the Council with four other elected Greens: making Lambeth home to the largest group of Green councillors in London.

In June 2019 he was also elected as Member of the European Parliament for London, winning the largest ever vote for a Green MEP candidate in the capital with 12.4% of the vote.

As a Councillor for Streatham St Leonard's Ward, Scott has gained a reputation for being one of Lambeth’s hardest working councillors – asking more questions on behalf of residents and being tenacious at getting things done. He fought alongside residents to defend their estates from demolition and compulsory 'regeneration'. He has worked to save local libraries from closure and to support culturally diverse independent businesses. Scott has also campaigned for justice for survivors of abuse in Lambeth's children’s homes. He also worked cross-party to secure the first ever successful motion to commit a local authority to support the call to set up an All-Party Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry for Truth and Reparatory Justice for the Transoceanic Trafficking of Enslaved Africans. He also helped ensure the motion was also passed with a large majority through the Green Party of England and Wales.

Scott believes Lambeth residents have a right to know how the Council spends public money. He helps the independent monitoring group, Lambeth Peoples’ Audit, follow the money and challenges the Council to become more open, transparent and accountable in the use of public funds so as to be in a better position to help everyone in the Borough and to ensure the council is not overdeveloped.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/71965.png

I grew up here and went to St Philomena’s School. I studied law and worked in a solicitors practice. I now work for the largest UK Charity for domestic abuse, supporting victims of gendered violence. One of my priorities as your Labour MP will be to work for a reduction in crime and violence against women and girls.

Alongside my 12 years of professional experience, I currently serve as a Councillor and am Labour’s Lead on Housing, campaigning to improve conditions in the social and private sectors. The UK is currently facing a national housing crisis. Sutton and Cheam faces the same pressures. Our children and grandchildren are unable to afford high rental costs or the chance to buy their first home. As your Labour MP, I will advocate for better quality and more affordable housing for all.

The NHS is on its knees. I am immensely grateful to the staff at The Royal Marsden who cared for my mother. I saw firsthand the pressure on our dedicated doctors and nurses. Labour has a plan to invest in and rebuild the NHS. I want to be a part of making those improvements as your Labour MP.

The last 14 years of Conservative Government, propped by the Liberal Democrat Coalition, have broken our country. Sutton and Cheam deserve better, and I will deliver the change our residents need.

Too often, the old parties abandon honesty and integrity in favour of short-term self-interest. Greens stand up for what they believe in.

Living in South Swindon with his family, Robert is the only candidate of the two main parties who lives in the Borough. He is out and about in Swindon each week, and has met thousands of local residents. Robert works closely with the North Swindon MP, providing a joint service to local people. He is not a career politician, having worked for nearly twenty years up to 2010 as a criminal legal aid barrister. 

As your MP, he has held over 135 Advice Surgeries in local supermarkets, community centres, workplaces and street corners. He has dealt with over 17,000 different items of casework. As a backbench MP, Robert helped to lead successful cross-party campaigns in Parliament to change the law on special educational needs, stalking, domestic abuse, child cruelty and carers. As a Government Minister, Robert has taken measures through Parliament relating to criminal law, immigration and our security services. He also refers sentences that are far too low to the Court of Appeal. Robert continues to work with local businesses and groups to attract more investment to Swindon.

As a fellow local resident, no-one is more determined than me to stand up for Swindon. In the past seven years, we have come a long way. But there is still more to do.

1. Creating Jobs

Keep promoting Swindon as a great place to do business, attracting even more skilled jobs to our town, building on the near 60% reduction in local unemployment since 2010.

2. Championing our Local NHS

Help to make sure that the 50% increase in Swindon health spending over the next 5 years is spent on a more co-ordinated and expanded service for local residents.

3. Work for even more investment

Build upon the over £169m investment in local infrastructure that we are receiving by pressing for more improvements to Swindon’s major road network and ensuring that we fully reap the benefits of the ongoing rail electrification.

4. Support our Local Culture and Heritage

Work with local heritage and culture groups to regenerate our historic buildings and showcase our cultural assets. Robert is Patron of the new Lydiard Park Community Trust.

5. Championing Success in Education

Work with local schools and colleges, the Council and the Government to further drive up standards and to give young people the skills they need for their future. 

6. An Approachable, Hardworking and Influential MP

To continue to be a hardworking, visible and approachable MP, visiting residents, holding regular Advice surgeries and making our case at the highest level.

I want to take control of immigration, whilst making sure that we can deliver the skills needed to keep our economy and public services strong.
 
I will work with the new West Midlands Mayor, Andy Street, to get more affordable houses built in Walsall North. Owning a home is a dream for many and I support Theresa May’s efforts to help young first-time buyers get on the housing ladder. 
 
More houses need to be built but shouldn’t come at the expense of green spaces around our community. I pledge to work to ensure that old, derelict brownfield sites and empty offices are used to provide new homes.

A Vote for the Green Party is not a wasted vote!

Without you demanding change it will be more business as usual, more oil and gas from the Conservatives and a Labour Party who will not stop it.

This will be your opportunity to influence policy for all, our planet, our environment, a more sustainable future, a fairer society.

Voters are increasingly turning to the Greens because we offer a real alternative, with sensible and practical policies to tackle local and national issues such as the cost of living, the housing crisis, underfunded and run-down public services and the terrible state of our rivers.

“As a Member of Parliament I would oppose the Rwanda Bill and protect vulnerable asylum seekers, support our NHS by properly funding it, and secure the investment necessary to prevent climate catastrophe.

As the appointed Vice Chair of a prominent social housing provider Voice Panel I represent the interests of social housing tenants across the North West, and work to raise standards in the sector.

This has given me a very important insight into the sector and how to improve and support providing much needed safe secure homes going forward.”",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/34124.png

We are all being impacted by the cost of living crisis, our local NHS is struggling, our public transport links are getting worse, our councils are being starved of funding, and our natural environment is being continuously damaged. This cannot go on.



I grew up round here, and want to help improve our area. It was in Cheshire that my parents made their new home after moving from India to work for the NHS. Growing up, as a young carer for my brother, I volunteered at local groups supporting people with learning disabilities. I saw first-hand the impact of Conservative policies on our local families and services. I want to help fix this as Tatton's first Labour MP - and the most local MP Tatton will have ever had.



I fight to support people and businesses every day, as a councillor and Cabinet Member. In my work, as an environmental policy expert, I fight for a more sustainable future, leading a team at an environmental non-profit organisation.



The polls show that Labour can win in Tatton. With my experience and background, policy expertise and local roots, I will serve the residents of Tatton and work to improve people's lives.

I made the case for free-use computers in the library, and have fought to save it from closure in 2011 and 2018. Right now I’m campaigning with other Labour candidates to convince the new council to secure the future of Taunton’s main post office by taking over the franchise. 

These are dark and difficult times for anyone on a limited income. Crucial services have been cut to the bone; too many households are suffering insecurity, hardship, and enforced homelessness.

Alan’s Grandad fed the kilns at Blockleys Bricks, his mum worked for the company building the M54, and he remembers Telford town centre when it was not much more than a Carrefour. Alan has also been a proud part of Telford’s growth and evolution. 

As a local business coach he’s supported start-ups and SME businesses to do business better. He’s volunteered for the Princes Trust as a Mentor, and supported his local community – not for personal gain, but because it’s the right thing to do.

Telford deserves a viable alternative to the status quo. A status quo which consists of an unprincipled Labour Council Leader who’s shown repeatedly that he’s in it for the prestige and power, or a little-known replacement Conservative candidate who does not know Telford and can’t be expected to ‘get’ us.

Elected / re-elected in 2019 and 2023 to Town and Borough and to County in 2021, I lead groups of four Greens at both Borough and County. I’m an experienced public speaker and my work has given me the extensive range of skills required for Parliament.

I found my way into politics in order to help protect our area and give voice to the strong feelings of residents. I really like helping, solving issues, putting people in touch and making our area a better, safer place to live. The support I have had from residents has been terrific and I am delighted every time I am able to achieve successful results for them. People said that they have felt especially cared for during the pandemic, as I kept them well informed via email and phone calls and I continue to send regular emails and flyers go out throughout the year, (not just at election time!).   I am also delighted that the Green Party are growing locally having increased our number by 300% in the last local elections. 

The Green Party aligns with my lifelong values. I ran for Parliament in 2017 and 2019 so my name is well-known and I’m very committed and I am asked on a daily basis if I’m the candidate again. I’m a firm believer in equality, justice and education; those lucky enough to have been taught to love our planet want to protect it. We need radical Government policy change and support for individuals too; many want to use alternatives to cars, but if there are no transport services or safe roads they cannot.

Alongside the many committees and working groups, I’ve packed much into the last few years, including conferences and courses where it’s good to network and share ideas, plus various trips to Westminster and visits to urban tree schemes, hydrogen businesses, farms, schools, recycling plants, solar panels on Gloucester Cathedral’s roof and more.

Protecting nature is now a high priority for many people; At Borough, I brought two successful Climate Emergency motions, (including an ecological emergency) and I chair the Climate and Ecology working group where a lot takes place, including the installation of a solar PV canopy which generates around 70% of site electricity.

I’m creative and very much enjoy organising and motivating people; From the Wildlife Trust’s 30 days Wild, I devised Tewkesbury Goes Wild, (over 40 free outdoor events, led by experts), I coordinate Tewkesbury’s Toad Patrol, lead a community group and ran a community speed watch, (now waiting for cameras). I also run free monthly Daytime Discos for people to enjoy tea, a chat, make friends, watch dancers, or join in to keep fit, I've set up Tewkesbury Dementia Action Alliance as we were the only Gloucestershire district without one and I am a huge advocate for our brilliant, monthly Repair Café too.

I work extremely hard, receive lots of case work and make positive change, including helping to save 2,000 trees from being felled; a site Tree Preservation Order was secured and I spoke at the appeal which was an amazing community victory. I’ve solved major issues with social housing, reinstated allotments and obtained emergency help for flood victims.

I’m also a musician, love dancing, long walks and locally grown or foraged food. I’m a Trustee of the Roses Theatre and part of the management team of Tewkesbury Nature Reserve.

I’m Cameron Thomas and I'm your Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Candidate in Tewkesbury Constituency. I first moved here following an assignment at Imjin Barracks in 2016, and settled with my family shortly afterward.

I'm not a career politician, I consider myself to be a public servant. 

I joined the RAF as a teenager in 2000 and served across the world prior to my resignation in 2023, so that I could stand to represent you. My specialisations were communications and information systems, policing and security, training and inclusion. I served on several operational deployments throughout my career, including 3 to Iraq, and to the Falkland Islands. One such deployment was an assignment to East Midlands NHS Trust, as a Military Planner to help issue Covid 19 Vaccines to thousands of residents across Leicestershire. I love and respect our NHS and will fight to protect it. It must be preserved so that help is there when we most need it. Doctors, nurses and staff must be supported and fairly paid.

I'm passionate about laying the foundations for young people to achieve their potential. Key to this is through a fair and well-funded education system; ours needs a complete overhaul and significant investment. It also means preserving our environment and increasing biodiversity. Nature is key to our mental health, and I want our children to enjoy the wealth of different species which we ourselves have enjoyed. I have been a marine conservation campaigner for 20 years and have joined and led expeditions in the Pacific Ocean, North Sea and English Channel. In our constituency, I have engaged with the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust and look forward to helping them preserve our biodiversity from Westminster if elected.

As a retired Military Police Officer, I am your law and order candidate, but I am driven by compassion, empathy and public service. I will always speak out against injustice and defend others when they need it... it's in my DNA. I hope that my background will convince you that I'll represent you with courage and integrity, because I will. For too long, those who represent us have taken us for granted, voted against our interests, broken the rules they themselves implemented, and then lied to our faces about it. We deserve leaders who'll set a better example. That's why I'm standing.

At this General Election, it's the Liberal Democrats who are best placed to beat the Conservatives. I'd helped campaign with the Lib Dems at the previous election, in which we finished 2nd, some distance ahead of Labour. Since then, our constituency has benefitted by electing more Lib Dem District Councillors at Cheltenham Borough, Tewkesbury Borough and Gloucester City Councils than every other party combined. Our councillors lead all 3 of those councils, and are delivering for residents every day. I am absolutely convinced that the Liberal Democrats are a force for good in UK politics, and are the most environmentally conscious party in the country. I am so proud to stand as their candidate, for you. I am a candidate for our entire constituency, and have been campaigning from Twyning in the North, to Longford in the South, from Apperley in the West, to Winchcombe in the East.

If elected, I pledge to work cross-party to: ✅ Defend our NHS, ✅ Tackle the cost of living crisis, and ✅ Protect our Environment. The Lib Dems have already taken the lead on these issues, where other parties have followed.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read about me. You can find more information at my website here: cameronthomas.co.uk.

Please, for change in Tewkesbury, vote for Cameron Thomas and the Liberal Democrats on 4th July 2024.

I have lived in Telford for 30 years and have worked for Community Arts, as a community and environmental officer for a local authority and now as the director of a social enterprise supporting adults with learning difficulties and a community cafe in Wellington. I have a proven record of community activism, chairing College Ward East Residents Association for 4 years promoting the interests of a much neglected part of Wellington. I have been re-elected 3 times as an independent councillor for College Ward believing that it is important and more effectual if you live in the ward you represent. I set up my own party - People First Party because of a deep distrust of the established Parties, which I feel is a universal view.
It was in 2015 that the Green Party's message reached me. They seemed to be the real party of change with radical ideas such as Universal Basic Income, real decentralisation of politics and our economy and a 'people first' rather than 'profits first' solution to some of the profound problems we face, that left me no option but to join them.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/34577.png

For far too long our communities have been neglected and ignored. In 2010 the Conservative and

Liberal Democrat coalition Government gave us austerity; a political choice that caused huge damage

locally and nationally. This damage has continued to this day. Now, 14 years later, we have seen the

decimation of local transport, health and social care provision and education.

Inequality is rising and costs are soaring. It does not have to be like this.



As a teacher I have seen this decline first-hand and that's why I am standing to be your next MP.

Labour's missions for a better Britain will transform our communities for everyone. I am proud to be

campaigning on these transformative plans, to support our rural economy and bring back fairness and

opportunity for all.



Our areas of Devon and Somerset deserve to have a strong voice in a transformative Labour

government. Someone who will truly work for them. I promise that I will listen to you, stand up for

you and be a hard working, visible and easy to contact MP....after all an MP is for the whole of the

I spent my childhood in Taunton Deane and since 2006 my family and I have lived in Bampton, which I am proud to represent as Lib Dem district councillor.

I’ve visited every corner of the constituency, our towns and villages, our coast, countryside and moorland, and have a thorough understanding of our many strengths – and the challenges we face.

When it comes to my professional skills, my time as both a director of the NFU and head of strategy at the Environment Agency lend me crucial experience in our rural constituency, and my volunteer experience with the Exmoor Foundation for Integrated Health Care has given me invaluable insight into community health care.

As a politician and a working mother, I’ve mastered many important skills. I love the fun and camaraderie of the campaign trail, and know how to keep people’s spirits up. I always treat my opponents with courtesy and respect, and I’ve never been afraid of speaking truth to power. I have a thick skin, a warm heart and I’m absolutely passionate about bringing a visible local representation to my long-ignored community.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/4997/b11f53a9-3289-4ef0-a54d-1cf6b597d50e.png

I’m running for parliament because I’ve seen how London isn’t delivering for us locally, and I want to change that. I’ve done it at a ward level, now I am committed to listening, working, and delivering for our constituency on what matters to you. From taking action on potholes to holding South West Water accountable for polluting our rivers and seas.

We’re a long way from London and I want to be your local seven-day-a-week MP in government. As your MP I will:

1. Keep It Green Get the water bosses to clean up the sewage in our water, make them criminally liable, and ban their bonuses.

2. Get Us Connected HS2 money should be for spent on our railways, not our potholes. I will to stand up for us in parliament to get our towns railways reinstated and buses that are on time.

3. A Fair NHS for Us We have lost our local hospitals, dentists, and doctors, making us travel and pay more. Labour founded the NHS and as your Labour MP I will fight to get the NHS back on it’s feet in Torridge and Tavistock.

4. Homes not Ghost Towns Our towns, villages, and parishes are at risk of being deserted if we don’t build or utilise housing to meet local needs. I want everyone to have a home and I will do everything I can to bring secure and affordable housing to local people.

5. Roads not Holes It’s the 21st century yet we have roads from the 19th because of government cuts. I’ll be championing the fair share we need for our roads and working people. Devon has the largest county road network, now it’s time to get the funding to match.

6. Learning for Life Education and skills training shouldn't be a luxury, it’s a necessity. A tenth of the money has gone from Devon schools since 2010, I want to get that back for our children, teachers, businesses, and future.

7. Pounds in Your Pocket Every penny counts. I know this and you know this.

She grew up in Perranwell in the heart of the constituency and went to the village school along with her brothers and older sister. Her dad was a GP in Devoran and Chacewater for thirty years, and her mum was also a GP and later worked at St Julia’s Hospice.

Ruth has a track record of public and community service through her career in the charity sector. At the NHS Confederation she worked with hospital trusts, charities and patient groups on issues facing the health service. She went on to work in a range of roles in the charity sector, working with charities and funders to help improve what they do.

Ruth lives in Perranwell and works for the university, based at the Knowledge Spa at Treliske Hospital. Her role involves bringing small businesses together with university researchers to support innovation, particularly around issues affecting work and health.

Why Ruth is standing for election
“The UK is at a crossroads and what happens in the next few weeks and months will affect all of us and how our country is seen around the world.

“Three quarters of people think that our political system is broken. Too many people feel that they have no way of making themselves heard and no real representation in Westminster where all the major decisions affecting our lives are made.

“I want to change that. Cornwall has been let down by its Conservative representatives. I think things can be better, and that’s why I’m standing as a Liberal Democrat to represent my home constituency.”

Ruth’s priorities are:

I live and work in the constituency having moved here 18 years ago when I married a naval pilot. Before that, I worked for a number of years as a solicitor representing working people who had accidents at work or employment claims.

As a single parent in Cornwall I put my legal skills to use at Cornwall Citizens Advice and then worked as a teaching assistant at Falmouth Secondary School for seven years while my son was in school.

I stood for Parliament for the first time in Truro and Falmouth in 2017 when we tripled the Labour vote here and made It a Conservative/Labour marginal constituency. I am now Labour Group Leader on Cornwall Council and also sit on Falmouth Town Council. Notable successes include proposing & pushing through Cornwall Council's Climate Emergency declaration, forcing a budget amendment to provide £3.5 million for mental healthcare for our young people in schools and shaping and campaigning on housing policy, which is such a vital issue in Cornwall.

My priorities for Truro and Falmouth are:

1\. The new Green Economy and decent, well-paid jobs that Cornwall needs and deserves.

2\. Tackling Cornwall's housing crisis.

3\. Saving and rebuilding Cornwall's NHS and social care.

I am working hard to be the next MP for Truro and Falmouth, so that I can be a strong and effective advocate for Cornwall in Westminster.

As a 23-year-old autistic, queer mother managing chronic health conditions, I understand firsthand the challenges faced by many. My personal journey has fueled my passion for social justice, and I believe I can deliver real change that benefits our people and our country. 

I am excited to stand as the Green Party candidate for Tynemouth, bringing a unique perspective shaped by lived experiences. In roles like youth councillor, YoungMinds youth panellist, and school governor, I have honed skills in public speaking, policy analysis, and community engagement. I have effectively advocated for young people and driven positive change.

Committed to Our Community

My commitment to equitable policies aligns with our community's values. Having faced economic hardship, homelessness, disability and so many other things alike myself, I genuinely understand the issues impacting many constituents. I'm not just advocating for change from an abstract position - I have lived these realities. 

My platform focuses on renationalising public services, equitable education, fair wages, sustainable development, and robust community engagement. These are necessary steps towards an inclusive, healthy, and prosperous society for all. To demonstrate my dedication, I pledge to donate £250 of my monthly salary to community support initiatives.

A Diverse Voice in Politics

What makes me well-suited for politics is my diversity of perspective as a young, autistic, queer individual managing chronic conditions. I bring much-needed representation to the political arena. With a proven track record in advocacy and leadership roles, I have the skills to navigate complex issues and uplift diverse voices.

I pride myself on transparency, openness, and authenticity. You can count on me to maintain this candor, ensuring constituents remain informed and involved in decision-making processes.

My Priorities:

* Social Justice and Equality: Inequality pervades housing, healthcare, education, safety, and well-being. Too many struggle to afford basic needs like food, energy bills, and are living in unsuitable accommodation - especially families and disabled individuals. Marginalised groups face heightened risks of hate and crime. I will work tirelessly to reduce inequality and improve living conditions for all.

* Environmental Sustainability: Protecting our environment is crucial. I will enhance biodiversity, plant more trees for climate resilience, implement effective sewage solutions for cleaner waterways, and help our community reach 99% renewable energy usage. Sustainable practices combat climate change for a livable future.

* Community Health and Wellbeing: Good health and wellbeing are vital for a thriving community. I will prioritise mental health support, create a sense of safety and belonging, ensure accessible healthcare, and advocate for policies upholding dignity like fair wages and universal basic income, as well as expanding community activities, spaces and services that tackle social isolation, mental health challenges, and crime.

Thank you.

I have lived in North Shields all my life. We live in a wonderful part of the country, but we desperately need a change from the old parties, that have let us down again and again.

Iam delighted to be standing for The Heritage Party in this election to make the change we need to restore our nation. Some of our priorities for Parliament are:

CONTROL OUR BORDERS. Mass, rapid immigration is out of control. We need to stop the boats and reduce net immigration to sustainable levels. The Heritage Party will push back illegal boats back to France. We will place strict caps on work and student visa's while training our own young people up to do the jobs that need to be done in this country.

NO NET ZERO. We will end the war on cars and carbon based energy. We say no to low traffic neighbourhoods, clean air zones, 15 minute cities and the coming ban on petrol and diesel cars. We will ensure we have cheap, reliable, continuous energy from coal, oil, gas and nuclear, to keep the lights on and power our business and industry. 

PROTECT OUR CHILDREN. Comprehensive Sexuality Education has been introduced by the Tories in England, Labour in Wales and the SNP in Scotland. School children are now being exposed to appalling lesson content that confuses them about gender, undermines traditional family values and encourages sexual experimentation. The Heritage Party will ban these lessons and make it illegal to sexualise children.

I went to local schools. My family have called Uxbridge & South Ruislip their home for generations. I'm here, ready to work hard to improve the area who made me who I am today. Raised by a single parent, my life was shaped by early struggle and poverty. It was my first experience of homelessness, that drove me to join the Labour Party when I was a teenager. Losing our home, when I was 15, forced my mother and I to leave the area -- but Ruislip is where my roots are.

I believe everyone has a right to a decent home. No one should not be able to afford to eat or heat their home. More and more families are now struggling because of the Conservative government's economic mismanagement over the last 14 years. Now we need change. Over almost a decade I've put my principles into practice. Through my nine years as a local councillor and cabinet member I've been finding solutions to tackle low pay, deliver new council homes and good work.

Now, as times get even tougher for families, I am determined to make fundamental change possible in Parliament. As a full-time local MP, I would work hard for a new hospital and better public services. Work tirelessly to deliver a stable and growing economy so that families feel hopeful about the future and to ensure we have more police on the street and safer communities.

I care very deeply about Warrington and all our communities. As a local councillor and Cabinet Member for Children, I've spent years working alongside local residents, businesses, schools, charities and others to deliver for our town.

Warrington is a great place to live but not everyone has a fair chance to succeed; not only to survive, but to thrive. In Warrington South we're stuck without a voice in Westminster. Saddled instead with a Tory 'yes man' who delivers nothing but claims credit for everything.

Times are tough right now. The Tory cost of living is biting hard. Public services have been stripped to the bone. Wages are not keeping up with inflation. Our NHS is undergoing managed decline. The Tories have damaged our country. Hurt our communities. Neglected our region.

But we're fighting back. In Warrington South we're building a united, people-powered campaign - to return a Labour MP to Westminster and a Labour Government to Downing Street - so that we can finally get the change we so desperately need.

Get in touch and get involved. Together, we'll take the fight to the Tories and we will win Warrington South for Labour.

This has only been made worse by poor choices from the Tories who have overseen the mismanagement of the Brexit deal, consistently acted against the interest of the country throughout the Coronavirus pandemic, and now during the devastating and spiralling cost of living crisis, are unable to get a grip on the economy and are unwilling to help those who most need it.

I will continue to hold this Conservative Government to account, to protect and improve your livelihoods and our local communities, trying to ensure nobody is left behind.

Labour's priorities will be the priorities of the British people: that starts with economic growth to provide the security our country needs to then rebuild Britain, so that it is the best country to grow up in, and the best to grow old in.

While our area is divided by a county border, it is united in potential to be an even better place for us to live, work and do business. On these pages, you can read, more about me and my priorities if elected as the first MP for Waveney Valley. 

As a Conservative, I want to protect and enhance what makes our country great – be it our countryside, farming community, heritage or culture. I want to protect free markets and harness and enhance our ability to innovate. I fundamentally believe in personal freedom and the ability of the individual, and society collectively, to improve lives and prosper when not overly burdened by regulation or taxation.

By freeing the individual and helping them to improve their lives through their own efforts, we can focus our support on those vulnerable members of society who most need it. All whilst allowing individuals to choose how they live their lives with minimal interference from the state.

I grew up in Suffolk where my father was a Consultant and my mother an Occupational Therapist at West Suffolk Hospital. My father, of whom I have no memory, died of cancer when I was little over a year old. His legacy in the community inspired me to public service. I watched my mother work hard to support us and struggled personally and academically after she remarried but fortunately found a mentor in a local businessman who encouraged me to strive for success. These challenging early years shaped much of my outlook today.

My grandparents were farmers and we’ve still a very small farm remaining. As a result, I’ve always been acutely aware of how our agricultural community, landscapes, countryside and wildlife all define, shape and sustain our nation. I’ve seen at first-hand how ill-conceived development, planning and energy policies can threaten these defining characteristics. Here in Waveney Valley, the importance of these issues could not be more acute. With a grandparent from Norfolk and Suffolk, I’m no stranger to the friendly rivalry between our two counties!

Family values are incredibly important to me. I live in Suffolk with my wife, Caroline, whose family home is in Mellis near Diss, and our five dogs.

I’ve experience across the private and public sector. My early career was spent advising Members of Parliament, parliamentary candidates and think tanks. This enabled me to learn, very quickly, how to get things done in Westminster. My work also focused on media relations and ensuring local communities benefitted from the best possible representation. Taking a break from the political sphere, I opened a gym which brought CrossFit to the community at an affordable price. During the same period, we diversified our small family farm through the creation of a wedding and events venue – now an award winning rural business. In 2017, I was elected to Suffolk County Council, where I serve as Deputy Leader.

I have become the most experienced politician in the UK at responding to Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs) in the energy sector. I have devised our strategy and response to numerous large energy projects and led negotiations with government and developers. I’ve led on our opposition to the East Anglia Green pylon run (now known as Norwich to Tilbury) and our calls for an offshore alternative, our negotiations with EDF around the delivery of Sizewell C, securing a compensation and mitigation package in excess of £200m for the region, alongside fighting proposals for the Sunnica Solar Farm. I have spoken on the national stage, and written for Conservative Home, about the importance of delivering energy security and how it must not come at the cost of good food producing land. This work requires me to meet regularly with government departments, ministers and officials to fight for the best deal for local communities.

I am an experienced and highly visible local campaigner and have served at all council levels from parish through to county. I know how to get things done and ensure local people have confidence in their elected representative.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/30964-23262715-70ab-42ae-9bd5-49c6c4d77fcc.png

I am writing to you today to express my passion and commitment to our community in Sevenoaks. As many of you know, we recently fought against developers and the council to stop the tower block and overdevelopment in our area. However, I believe that the threat of overdevelopment is far from over. That is why I have decided to stand for the District Council in Sevenoaks Northern.

I firmly believe that it is time for a change. We need a new voice on the council who will prioritize the needs and concerns of our community. If elected, I will work tirelessly to ensure our community remains safe, prosperous, and sustainable. My priorities include supporting local businesses and responsible growth that preserves the character of our community, as well as opposing reckless overdevelopment, including tower blocks.

I am also firmly against policies such as ""15-minute cities"" and other restrictions on movement that could have a negative impact on our community. Instead, I will work to promote a balanced approach to development that considers the needs of our community and respects our way of life.

I hope I can count on your vote in the upcoming election on the 4th of May. Together, we can ensure that our community remains a beautiful place to live, work, and raise a family.

As an elected councillor I will be able to better represent resident’s views and can encourage more cross-party consensus on the council. Local government is for local people. Even one lone Green voice can change the debate, challenge the status quo and ensure local people concerned about local issues, social justice and climate change have an effective voice.  Singlers Marsh becoming a village green is still a very important issue for many local people, not least as it will prevent overdevelopment nearby and protect our precious chalk river. I have consistently supported the application from the beginning of the campaign, when the Conservative-led Council initially opposed the application. For reasons never fully disclosed the Council still oppose the application and are intent on committing tens of thousands of pounds of local taxpayers' money to a legal battle against the will of residents. Village green status will not jeopardise any activity that takes place on there already, including the Welwyn Festival, but will protect it from development nearby. Green support for this issue has encouraged some councillors from other parties to change their mind on this application. The 240 house development that is planned adjacent to the Marsh would change the nature of that area forever and the resulting traffic and strain on local services would be huge. Welwyn housing has grown by over 30% since I’ve lived here which is considerably more than many other small villages in the Borough. It is time for the housing quotas to be spread more fairly. If I get elected to Council I will lobby for the Singlers Marsh application to be passed immediately. It is in the Council’s power to grant village green status right now and not one councillor has explained why it has not been granted. It is a colossal waste of money to fight this in the courts, taxpayers money that could be much more profitably spent elsewhere. If the council still refuse I believe it would be a good next step to have a public meeting about this matter.  I have run the village litter pick (Welwyn Rubbish Action Group) for the last 14 years or so. Sadly there is always plenty to pick up, but hopefully our volunteers make our ward a more pleasant and tidy place. I liaise with the Council on reporting of litter and fly-tipping around the area. I would like to encourage expansion of Welwyn Rubbish Action Group to Oaklands and rural roads around Welwyn East and West.  Roads and crossings are not the responsibility of the Borough Council but I would like to lobby for safer routes to school from Welwyn village. Due to the road layout walking towards Welwyn Garden City from Welwyn is particularly hazardous. I support 20mph in Welwyn and lower speed limits elsewhere around the ward.  I would like to explore the possibility of getting more solar panels on schools, businesses, and public buildings. I have already made contact with a group in Hertford who have helped schools in Hertford install solar and am initiating a conversation with the local primary school. Also trying to find out if a community energy project might be possible .",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/82823/553032d3-647a-4804-87b2-f88387d94350.png

I was born in Welwyn Garden City and live in the constituency with my young family.

I live my Labour values through my work in social housing, as a supporter of local and national charities and time spent as a trustee of a credit union.

After thirteen years of a Conservative government and eighteen with Grant Shapps as the MP, our constituency is growing more unequal. There is a 10 year gap in life expectancy between people living in the centre of Hatfield and Welwyn Village, despite being just a few miles apart.

Our towns and villages have a proud history and vibrant community spirit, but people have been let down too often by the Conservatives. They deserve better.

As a local candidate with national experience, I am ready to take on Grant Shapps and believe we can secure a historic Labour gain in Welwyn Hatfield at the next General Election.

The North East has been my home since 2005, my roots are here and it is where I have chosen to bring up my family.



I was elected as a local councillor in 2022 and since then have led on education for the Labour group and campaigned for children to be able to walk and cycle safely to school. I was motivated to stand as a councillor because of my concern for the world that my children and other children were growing up in. The impact of climate change is apparent in the north east as elsewhere and I want my children to grow up in a greener, fairer Britain than we have today.



I have worked in further and higher education for over twenty years. Our young people are being failed by broken promises from both governments at Westminster and Holyrood. Broken promises on class sizes, teacher numbers, attainment, nursery places, I could go on. Our FE colleges are in crisis and our universities are suffering from a completely broken funding model.



I hope to play a part in helping a Labour Government to make a difference to our communities here in West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine. If you live in the constituency and have any questions or thoughts please do get in touch.

He is currently a councillor on Bridport Town Council, and has been a councillor on Dorset Council.

Prior to entering politics Kelvin worked as a firefighter for 17 years. On leaving the Fire Service he went to university as a ‘mature student’ and then re-trained to become a careers adviser. Whilst working as a careers adviser he continued his university studies on a part-time basis, finally gaining a PhD in philosophy. Philosophy has been his passion for many years, and he has a strong belief in the value of community philosophy and the teaching of critical thinking. He runs a local Philosophy in Pubs group.

If elected, what would be his priorities? “Well,” he says, “there is so much that needs changing it’s hard to know where to start. Obviously the government needs to start listening to the scientists and take climate and environmental issues seriously. It needs to drastically rethink its planning policies and start a programme that insures that all our homes are warm, dry and insulated. The UK has the worst quality housing stock in Europe. And it needs to take all public utilities back into public ownership – it’s scandalous that some people are making a fortune out of the energy market whilst others can barely afford to keep warm.”

Which is pretty much what you would expect from a Green Party candidate. But is there anything else he would like to change? “Yes,’ he replies, “we need to start doing politics differently. This should include the obvious move to proportional representation, but also the restructuring of Parliament to make it less confrontational. We need to start having open and honest discussions, and we need to open-up these discussions to as many people as possible. I would like to see a move towards greater public participation in decision making.”",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/23741/260297d2-86a4-4e2c-964c-a0714c96239d.png

My professional background means I will hit the ground running as your MP for West Suffolk.  I have worked in Whitehall, in Parliament and on Education policy at the Eastern Region’s Government Office, covering Suffolk.

I know how government works at all levels and how to represent and support the constituents of West Suffolk effectively.

More recently I’ve served as a Councillor supporting local people, and helping resolve their problems; and I will continue to serve the local community, through my regular constituency surgeries.

For me, being an elected politician isn’t about ego and ambition, but about being present in the constituency. I appreciate the responsibility and privilege it is to serve people here.

I’ve lived in East Anglia for 27 years and raised my boys here. West Suffolk is a beautiful area of the country but is not without its problems.

Meeting residents in Newmarket at All Saints Church’s Warm Hub, I learnt how youngsters with special needs, were losing out on the support they, and their families, need to build a basic quality of life, and not just an existence.

I am highly concerned that there is no post 16 years provision in Newmarket and a real scarcity of public transport options to get youngsters to alternative sites, independently.

I’ve visited the proposed site for the biodigester at Haverhill and am appalled at the plans that are so inappropriate for the area, and offer absolutely no benefit to the residents. It’s environmental vandalism and I reject it.

We are facing an unprecedented cost of living crisis; in addition, many local councils have been starved by The Conservatives, for more than a decade, of the financial necessities to ensure the basic minimum of service.

Local Councillors at West Suffolk Council (WSC), have committed to supporting the local community facing this issue, to the tune of more than £450 000. 

Local councils are having to plug the gaps in provision, left by 14 years of the Tory governments starving local communities of their support to fully function.

Similarly, national government has been incapable of keeping the UK’s roads in working order.

Pot-holes are big problem for this rural constituency, and the majority Conservative County Council has simply not done enough to ensure that local people are safe on the roads.

Health, Education and the provision of Public Transport are also key targets for the Party and for Rebecca. We promise to deliver nationally and locally on these pledges.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/96118/e777f518-511d-48eb-9a16-592e83efec66.png

Raised in Suffolk/West Suffolk from age ten, Katie has dedicated her adult life to her community and her family. After becoming a town councillor in 2019, Katie has been actively taking action.

Katie established baby banks, fought to ensure children were fed during school holidays, and assisted vulnerable local residents during Covid.

Like many people, Katie does not believe in party candidates who have not lived locally and therefore don’t understand the needs of the local people. As an independent candidate, Katie’s only obligation will be to serve the best interests of the people of West Suffolk

Having grown up on a council estate and battled  addiction, Katie’s perseverance and determination have seen her enter a rehabilitation centre in 2004 and then continue to rebuilt her life. She has built a career working in local drug services, rehabilitation centres and local domestic abuse services and is a well respected member of the community.

Katie understands the genuine problems and concerns facing the residents of West Suffolk, particularly the difficulties of living in a rural community. By electing a truly independent local politician, we can avoid putting another person in power who prioritises their own narrow party politics over the people they’re meant to serve.

Katie's unrelenting dedication to her community is crucial as she understands the specific issues and concerns of West Suffolk residents.

~ Katie will fight for investment in LOCAL public and support services for the people of West Suffolk.

~ Prioritise council homes in the area with a focus on social housing and tackling homelessness.

~ Prioritise investment in children and youth service's, including mental health and the redevelopment of children's centres/youth clubs.

~ Push to renationalise our utilities and NHS, and put an end to cuts, closures and outsourcing.

~ Seek a meaningful wage increase essential for staff working in the NHS, schools, and social care.

The son of two teachers, Alec was born in 1976 and educated at his local comprehensive school. He studied mechanical engineering at Brunel University where he graduated with honours in 1998. After graduation, Alec joined the Royal Navy before moving to Yorkshire where he managed the Nanotechnology Facility at the University of Leeds.

Alec has served as the Member of Parliament for the Wetherby area since 2010, winning the Elmet & Rothwell constituency from Labour. Alec's working week is usually spent in the House of Commons Monday to Thursday, before he returns home to hold a mixture of one-to-one advice surgeries, supermarket surgeries and street surgeries on Fridays and Saturdays. Alec is regularly out and about campaigning across the revised Wetherby & Easingwold listening to the views of voters. 

Alec has been a committed constituency Member of Parliament and has driven forward a mission to make his constituency dementia friendly, including the publication of his Dementia Directory. Improving dementia services is a personal commitment for Alec and he is already planning the expansion of his Dementia Strategy into Boroughbridge, Easingwold, Tadcaster and surrounding villages.

His constituents describe Alec as someone who gets things done, whether it's supporting local charities, securing victory for a ten year campaign to fund new disabled-access at a local railway station, or delivering funds to rebuild four local schools.

Alec is a former Minister of State for Defence and was in charge of military procurement. During his time in Parliament, Alec has served as a Chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Thalidomide and, in conjunction with the Thalidomide Trust, secured the extension of an £80m Thalidomide health grant to support the independent living of victims of the Thalidomide drug. In Parliament, he has also secured Adjournment Debates to raise matters associated with dementia care, welfare support and sentencing for drink-driving offences. He is a champion for workers’ rights and introduced the National Minimum Wage (Workplace Internships) Bill to the House of Commons, calling for the abolition of unpaid internships. Alec has led a series of debates on women's health, calling for further awareness of Endometriosis and better support for patients injured during pelvic mesh surgery.

Alec takes a keen interest in foreign affairs. After a period serving as a Parliamentary Private Secretary in the Foreign & Commonwealth Office between 2014 and 2015, former Prime Minister David Cameron appointed Alec as a UK representative to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in December 2015. Since then, Alec has concentrated on defence and security matters within the alliance and was appointed Leader of the UK Delegation in 2020.

Alec has represented the United Kingdom at a number of Rose Roth seminars, bringing together NATO partner countries. He also took part in election monitoring in Georgia’s 2016 General Election.

Alec is a former Vice-Chairman (International) of the Conservative Party, a role which involved building relationships with international sister parties and working with the Westminster Foundation for Democracy to enhance democratic institutions and political party structures in the developing world.

Alec is a Formula 1 enthusiast and is a former Deputy Chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Formula 1, so he enjoys spending a few hours watching the Grand Prix on a Sunday.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/4036/49fd1727-7a2d-49d3-bf31-8908a8a85bca.png

West Cumbria has a proud history of shaping the UK's future and we can again. Our biggest problems all have answers here. But we've been stuck on the wrong path for years thanks to the Tories, who've failed to deliver for our area, crashed the economy and left thousands of local families struggling to make ends meet and worried for the future.



I have a record of delivery outside politics that shows you can have confidence in me to get the job done as your MP. My whole career has been spent delivering change for those left out or forgotten. Whether as a teacher working in tough schools, founding and leading a national charity which recruited thousands more social workers, or leading a landmark national review for vulnerable children which delivered £200 million of new investment to support children and families.



As your MP I will fight for and deliver for West Cumbria. I'll be spending the next few months meeting thousands of local people, listening to your concerns and turning those into my priorities to deliver as your MP after the next General Election.

I grew up here, was educated here, and have started my own family here. I have come to know and understand the many faces of Wimbledon – there are so many great things about the area, but there is also so much we could do better. 

Locally my interests are:

-	Improving access to green space, and protecting what we already have.   -	Urban greening as a tool to tackle flood risks, heat island effects, well-being and air quality.   -	Sensible planning decisions that bring needed infrastructure and development to the area without compromising on nature or pricing out local residents.   -	Attracting green industries and jobs, bringing meaningful training and employment opportunities to all.   -	Listening to you. I want more ways for people to be heard – from citizen assemblies to transparent consultation. Got an idea? Let me know. 

Nationally, I want to see:

-	Protection for nature at all levels of decision-making.   -	A properly funded and staffed NHS.    -	School curriculums that are relevant to the 21st century.   -	Affordable homes, built to the top environmental standards.   -	The UK backing an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Israel.   -	Clean waterways and the end of sewage dumping into our seas and rivers.

Check out the Green Party’s manifesto for more bold ideas and how we would achieve them. 

About me

I have dedicated my life so far to understanding and implementing solutions to the climate emergency and other sustainability challenges. In my current job, I design and originate new projects that remove or avoid greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Prior to this, I have worked as a freelance environmental consultant, science and maths tutor, and director of a small sustainable development charity working in the South Pacific. I hold two masters degrees, in Natural Sciences and Green Chemistry from global top 10 universities, and also spent many years researching novel plant-based materials. I am an alumni from the pan-European EIT Climate KIC programme, placing me in an international network of climate entrepreneurs. 

When I’m not working, I spend my time hanging out with my family, walking the dog, cycling, going to the theatre, discussing books with the local bookclub, doing DIY and, if there’s any time left, painting.

What sort of a politician would I be?

It is clear to me that the solutions we need to solve the climate and nature crises already exist, but the political will to get behind these solutions is absent. This is why we need Green politicians in parliament: to bring the knowledge and big ideas to the forefront of the national conversation. 

To me, green solutions are not about disruption and personal sacrifice, they are about the opportunity to live better. Keeping nature and the environment at the heart of decision-making at all levels is a one-pot strategy for tackling multiple challenges at the same time. Increasing access to nature, for example, is known to promote wellbeing, improve physical health, lower crime rates, combat urban heat island effects, strengthen communities, clean our air and of course absorb CO2. Prioritising joined-up strategies that address multiple problems simultaneously is also a way to do more with less – let’s spend smarter, not look for magic money trees. 

 Final Word

We don’t inherit the world from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children. As a parent to a young child, I have one eye firmly set on her future. And this is why I feel the great imperative to stand for the Greens: there’s no time to waste. The Green Party is the only party that will put the climate emergency first, and no other candidate for Wimbledon is better placed than I am to navigate, mitigate and adapt to the urgent climate and sustainability challenges we face. 

A Green vote is not a wasted vote, it’s a vote for good ideas – the right ideas to navigate the climate emergency. It’s a vote that puts the needs of our children above the interests of big business. It’s a vote that gets the attention of the other parties. It’s a vote that gets our policies noticed – and emulated. And in particular, it’s a vote that gets Greens funded – meaning more Greens standing in more elections, and ultimately, more Greens in power.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/48176/fc0924a9-e281-4727-9ae5-3560cd3d7ed7.png

Let me tell you a little about myself: what makes me tick, my family life, my political ethos, and why on earth I'm venturing into politics.

Turning 50 this year, I've shared nearly a quarter of a century of adventures with my husband, Gordon, a true Wimbledon native whose roots run deep in this verdant soil. 

Gordon was born in Nelson Hospital, now Nelson Health Centre, and raised in South Wimbledon. He and his siblings went to Pelham Primary School, and my brothers-in-law then went to Wimbledon Chase. 

Together, Gordon and I are blessed with three energetic sons—Oscar, Hugo, and Theo—and our faithful labradoodle companion, Strider—named after a favourite character in The Lord of the Rings—who adds a touch of whimsy to our lives. 

Our family thrives on activity and a zest for life, finding solace and excitement in the green expanses of Wimbledon Common and Wimbledon Park. It's here, amidst nature's embrace, that we let off steam and recharge our batteries before facing life's next challenge: a visit to the grandparents! 

Speaking of which, they have lived in Wimbledon for almost 60 years, and, having been regular attendants for just as long, my father-in-law is now an Elder at Trinity United Reformed Church. My mother-in-law would love it if we moved in next door. But that's a conversation for another day... 

Like many of us, I've lived and worked in different corners of the globe. However, there's something special about Wimbledon that keeps on pulling me back. I've developed a profound appreciation for the unique tapestry of Wimbledon's charm and spirit. 

Let's face it, politics as usual has left many feeling disillusioned and disenchanted. I share the sentiment that it's time for a different approach. And that's where I come in. I want to do politics differently. 

I'm not your typical politician; I bring a dash of dynamism and a wealth of real-world experience to the table. As a former British triathlete with a knack for business and trade, I understand the value of grit and determination in overcoming obstacles. 

For me, governance isn't about empty promises or political posturing; it's about rolling up our sleeves and tackling challenges head-on, together. I'm a believer in the power of enterprise, innovation, and common-sense solutions to drive progress. I recognise the transformative potential of education in driving social mobility, on which so many other outcomes depend.

From navigating the complexities of family life to representing my country on the global stage, I've honed my convictions and my resolve. I'm passionate about making a tangible difference, both in the lives of individuals and in safeguarding our natural environment for future generations. 

As Wimbledon's champion, I'm committed to being a problem solver, bridging divides, and fostering a sense of unity within our vibrant community. 

If you're ready for someone who's not afraid to step up to the tough challenges of modern life, and if you're ready for someone who unashamedly gets things done, then let's work together to make Wimbledon an even better place for all. 

Thank you for reading. If you want to know more, please continue.

BUSINESS

I understand and support small businesses.  

Growing up, my father, a highly respected research scientist in organic chemistry, spearheaded our family's venture. It began with an experiment conducted in our kitchen oven, with a wishbone from a Sunday roast thrown in. This endeavour yielded a breakthrough: an active ingredient central to catalytic convertors in cars worldwide. 

Witnessing the power of a simple idea born at our kitchen table, I learned firsthand how British innovation coupled with a can-do attitude can spark a global impact. Tragically, I lost both my parents, my guiding lights, to cancer. Yet that legacy endures, instilling in me the belief that solid science aligned with sound finances can bring about transformative change for the better.

Following university life, I honed my skills in the demanding environment of London's financial district, mastering technical precision and thriving under pressure.  

My career path led me to the realm of exports, collaborating with British diplomatic missions to address global demands with British solutions. From exporting leadership training (RMA Sandhurst) to advising on highlighting British excellence, I've championed our nation's interests worldwide, particularly spotlighting local enterprises, the backbone of the British economy.  

Post-the pandemic, witnessing the struggles of local businesses inspired me to lend a hand. Presently, I lead a dedicated team, revitalising local economies by boosting foot traffic, increasing efficiencies, and facilitating employment opportunities.  

SPORT

As a two-time triathlon World Championships representative for Great Britain, I understand the discipline and resilience required for high-performance athletic qualities, which are equally crucial when it comes to fighting for Wimbledon & the Maldens in Parliament, getting things done, and developing good policy.

Active involvement in local associations and serving as a parish councillor have only bolstered my endurance. I'm committed to representing the diverse interests of our strong community with the same rigour that I brought to my athletic pursuits.  

Moreover, I advocate passionately for inclusive sports participation, recognising its role in fostering well-being and community cohesion. That’s why access to a variety of green spaces in Wimbledon & the Maldens is non-negotiable. They are not just essential but also a source of joy and connection for residents.  

FAMILY

My most significant role is that of a mother to three boys—a role that continuously challenges and fulfils me. Having experienced both stay-at-home and working motherhood, I empathise with the joys and struggles of balancing familial and professional responsibilities.  

I'm ambitious for our young people and strive to ensure every child receives the support and encouragement needed to reach their full potential. With two of my boys diagnosed with dyslexia, I intimately understand the hurdles parents face in nurturing children, especially those with learning differences.  

So, this is me—a small business champion, a sports enthusiast, and a mum on a mission. I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and make a difference.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/116087/3aaf23b1-599d-4cae-a862-913b29dbfc20.png

I am a local businessman, husband to Debbie, a father and a grandfather. I have been a business owner for over 40 years’ and I want to bring this entrepreneurial experience to the role of MP to grow the local and national economies while looking after your local needs in Parliament.

In 2020 myself and Debbie started the Datchet Corona Volunteers at the outbreak of the pandemic and showed how we are and continue to put our communities first. In May 2022, I became the Chairman of the Datchet Parish Council to start giving residents a voice in local matters and a place to bring local issues to. I work with members of both Horton and Wraysbury Parish councils on united matters like flooding, public transport and local volunteer and community groups.

After voting for the Conservative Party for over 30 years I could see that all party politics was broken and no longer represented me. Realising that to get real change, I decided, I had to ‘walk the walk’ so became an independent candidate under the umbrella of “the Borough first Independents” in the 2019 local elections. In early 2020 I became the Leader of The Borough First Independents to offer a real alternative to the party politics that has lost sight of local needs, the economy, and its core values.

The Conservative party can no longer be trusted with our public finances, and we have no where to take our local needs. So I wish to offer a place for your vote for positive change and to put you first.

There will be no excuses because I will represent you and push your needs forward. By supporting me with your vote, I will be able to get things done for you. Your elected representative should support you, work for you, and improve your local quality of life, while supporting the building of a strong growing economy to give ourselves and our loved ones the quality of life we require.

In the local elections in 2023/4 the Windsor constituency has seen locally elected Independents become the largest political movement and now we need to see this at a higher level by voting an Independent into Parliament. This will link the people to Parliament for Windsor for the first time in history. If you support me, I will make sure you are not forgotten again and you are not alone.

In that time, she has served in a number of Cabinet positions, as Deputy Leader and is now the Leader of the Labour Group.



In her time as councillor, she spearheaded the award winning regeneration of Britwell, established the Slough Apprenticeship Awards and set up Slough Youth Parliament, leading to a national award by the Speaker of the House of Commons. She serves as Armed Forces Champion and has been influential in ensuring that Commonwealth veterans are recognised locally for their service when serving alongside British troops.



She will stand up and be a strong voice for all residents in the new Windsor constituency. Residents have been badly let down by the Conservative government as well as by an absent local MP who has taken the voters in Windsor for granted. Her priorities include; ensuring effective flood defences and driving improvements in water quality; tackling the cost of living crisis; full support for Windsor's military community and their wider families; tackling knife crime that blights parts of Langley; protecting land from inappropriate development and importantly, being a visible, accessible and dedicated full-time MP. If elected as Windsor's MP, Pavitar would fight for every resident of Windsor in Westminster and show the difference having a present and engaged MP could make.

14 years of Conservative rule has caused decline for our country on so many levels: 

The NHS has been grossly underfunded. The planning system has been become the plaything of big landowners and developers, where more and more greenfields are being built on, but the need for truly affordable housing for local people, to rent or buy, is not being met. Protection of the environment has been weakened, resulting in the loss of so many hedges and trees and the scandal of sewage pouring into rivers. The Conservatives have also failed to have a balanced transport policy, spending the Lion's Share of available funds on roads, generating ever more traffic and ever worse congestion - and failing to maintain roads and pavements properly. Potholes have become a serious problem in many areas. For many local people, the Cost of Living remain a major concern, while at the same time under the Tories, the top earners in society have greatly increased their wealth.    

If elected as the MP for Witham my focus would be local - helping people with their issues whenever I can, as I do now as a councillor, and working hard to secure investment in the constituency to improve services. A top priority remains as it has been for many years - a Community Hospital for Wiitham town that would serve nearby villages as well.   

Whilst I support improvements to the A12 and A120 to make them safer, this should be done by avoiding taking large areas of countryside. Transport funding needs to be rebalanced - such as the proposal by our I&G councillor group at Braintree District Council to deliver Dutch-style off-road cycling and walking routes to link the towns and main villages.

I would work with local communities to oppose unsustainable development. Many areas of the constituency are being targetted with proposals for more quarries, the Rivenhall Airfield waste incinerator, major off-line road developments and the ""New Towns"" which we helped to fight off a few years ago - but may return. The largest of these at 'West Tey' would have resulted in urban sprawl from Stanway to Coggeshall and Feering. Housing is needed - but the focus should be affordable housing for local people, where councils genuinely work with local communities to agree the best locations for housing - and employment.  

            

James has stood as a Green candidate at every General Election since 1992 and has been a Braintree District Councillor continuously since 1999, representing Silver End & Cressing ward. He is currently Deputy Leader of the Independent & Green Group (I&G) at BDC, which is the main opposition to the Conservatives.

James has also been a parish councillor in Rivenhall continuously over the same 25-year period and was the County Councillor for Witham Northern division from 2013 to 2021.

He holds a science degree and is a former national Green Party Spokesperson for Science & Technology, and also Climate Change. A campaigner since the early 1980s, James has supported many causes and has been involved in many issues, including planning, transport, energy, health, animal welfare, waste/recycling, climate and protecting the countryside and habitats, particularly trees and woodlands.

James lives in the Witham constituency with his family. He went to school in Witham and then Colchester before studying for a degree in Astronomy at UCL. He has previously worked as an archaeologist and ran a gardening and landscaping business for 30 years. He writes articles and gives talks on astronomy, green politics and the environment.

I have lived in Witham for C’k 18 yrs and is deeply committed to making positive changes in the community.

One of my primary focuses is on the issue of policing in Witham. I recognise that there is a lack of funding for law enforcement and a shortage of officers on the beat. It’s seems illogical to me to close Witham police station especially as the town is dramatically expanding.

If elected, I plan to work closely with the police department to ensure they receive the resources they need to keep our community safe.

Additionally, I’m deeply concerned about the state of our local schools. With over-stretched budgets, our schools are struggling to provide our children with the education they deserve.  I believe that education is the key to a better future and i’m committed to finding solutions to ensure our schools have the resources they need to succeed and the engagement from the community, parents, pupils and teachers.   Finally, I’m  committed to addressing the issue of limited access to doctors' appointments. Many members of our community are unable to see a doctor when they need to, which can have serious consequences for their health and well-being. I will work tirelessly to address this issue and ensure that everyone in our community has access to the medical care they need.

With my experience and dedication, I feel I’m a good candidate for Witham  North. I absolutely believe politics should be representation of the local man focused on local issues..  the current top managed down approach from the government clearly isn’t wrong.

We need to unite dnd reform against the system., we can put the Great back into Britain 

In summary, i’m committed to working hard to improve the lives of everyone in our community and is passionate about making a positive impact. 

A Vote for me “Tim Blaxill” on election day will not be a wasted vote and together, we can build a better future for Witham.

What needs to happen? It’s simple..  The change starts with you, with me, with everybody. We all need to take a collective responsibility for the disastrous last few years by chucking out those who seek to abuse power and replacing those who are focused on community.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/105577/1cef6b29-49bf-469f-a392-eacb25081e4c.png

From there she learned hard work, drive and compassion. The daughter of Nigerian immigrants, she also learned that Labour was the only party that could be relied upon.



She is standing to be Woking's first Labour MP because it is a town full of hardworking people who deserve to have their voices heard in the halls of Westminster. She cares deeply about the town and its communities --- and she wants to use her experience to help address the areas where Woking has been failed by 14 years of Tory austerity, and to champion the areas where it is leading the way.



Labour values have driven her throughout her career and led her to becoming a financial journalist, where she uncovered financial corruption and wrote about pro-democracy movements.



As a board member for a mental health charity, she developed a peer support programme during the pandemic that supported vulnerable people and helped them find community.



As a local councillor, she has a strong track record of being a voice for the voiceless. She brought ThamesWater executives before the committee to demand that the cost of their spiralling debts not be passed onto consumers.



She has continually fought to resolve complex casework, ranging from meeting emergency housing needs, to supporting vulnerable residents with mobility issues, to tackling serious breaches of environmental regulations. She is currently a cabinet advisor with the portfolio of improving health inequalities for women, through which she has called on the government to launch a full statutory enquiry into maternity safety.



And during the Cost of Living Crisis, Ese raised hundreds of pounds for people struggling to heat their homes by trekking to Everest Base Camp.

Our city could be thriving, but it's been let down by a government lacking vision. Our roads and busses, our healthcare and hospital are failing under the Conservatives' neglect. Our schools are in crisis and local businesses are closing.

Meanwhile we face climate breakdown, a global emergency, and the realities of daily life make change seem impossible.

I'm standing because I believe there's hope.

I've dedicated my business career to building the green economy by decarbonising heat. I head Bosch's innovation team developing hydrogen-ready boilers, and I am an industry leader in hydrogen and zero-carbon heat. I speak publicly at various conferences informing the Westminster energy debate.

As a City Councillor, I tackled the climate crisis head on, pushing for higher local ambition to insulate buildings and develop strategy for safe streets to walk and cycle. I fought for outdoor play for children. I know the tough reality of life for many in Worcester and through casework I've made a difference.

We can transform lives and build a sustainable economy, by putting people at the centre of our politics and economy.

I stepped up because I want to see integrity and leadership in politics. I'm part of this city - I use our local services and my children go to local schools. I have built and led teams, and brought change in business, industry and national policy.

I'm ready to be what Worcester deserves - a present, truly local MP with a vision for our city, and an effective voice in Westminster.

I am a dedicated and experienced candidate seeking your support in the upcoming general election. In the 2019 election, I had the privilege of receiving over 20,000 votes, and I am once again asking for your support.

I am passionate about advocating for the rights of the Women Against State Pension Inequality (WASPI) campaign. I strongly believe in fighting for justice and fair treatment for all individuals affected by this issue.

During the lockdown in 2020, I co-founded the Wycombe Food Hub initiative. This initiative aimed to support and provide essential food supplies to vulnerable members of our community. This project still exists today and it feeds over 500 families a week. It was a humbling experience to witness the strength and unity of our community during challenging times.

As a councillor from 2011 to 2021, I have had the opportunity to work closely with the residents of Wycombe, understanding their concerns, and striving to address their needs. Additionally, I served as the mayor of Wycombe from 2014 to 2015. During my tenure, I successfully raised £36,000 for The Cardiomyopathy Association and Diabetes UK, organizations that are close to my heart.

I want local people to be better off, with stronger bonds of friendship and community and greater control over political power and public services.

That is why I am proud to stand with Theresa May as your local Conservative candidate in the most important election in our lifetimes.

Just 11 days after this election, negotiations with the EU will begin which will determine our place in the world and the basis of our prosperity for generations to come.

At this time, we need a government with the strength, stability and clarity to get the best deal for our country and to make the most of the opportunities before us.

We can and should emerge from this period of change both stronger and more prosperous than ever before, taking a new lead on today’s major issues. 

We will create a strong economy that works for everyone. We will achieve a new place in our changing world, building a society in which we can all advance as far as our talents allow.

We will ensure fairness to people of all ages as we prepare our country to be prosperous and secure in the digital age.

Theresa May is not offering easy answers to complex problems.

After coming to the conclusion that 12 hour days and 7 day weeks maybe weren’t for the long term I moved into a more professional career.  

After moving into Financial Services and qualifying as a Financial Advisor I fell into recruitment with a compliance and audit consultancy, and recruitment has been my mainstay for 20 years now.  I get huge enjoyment from helping people with their career development, and seeing them grow.  I started my own recruitment business in 2014 and I specialise within Environmental Consultancy and Engineering Design.  It’s an area that challenges me to learn daily and keeps me on my toes.  

With my home hat on, I’m a Mum to an inspiring 13 year old, Step Mum to a creative 14 year old, and wife to my wonderful husband who supports me in everything I do, even adopting a pair of very cheeky (if a little naughty) rescue terriers!  We live in Prestwood and I love nothing more than getting out into the hills at the weekends in an attempt to tire the dogs out... (fat chance).

I’m passionate about people, and the environment.   This year (2021) I received my regular Green Party email to advise that there wasn’t a Green candidate standing in my area in the council elections, and so I thought, it’s probably not just me who is sad about this, so with the support of the amazing Chiltern Group of the Green Party, decided to stand.  I’m so glad I made this choice.  1037 other people also clearly wanted a Green voice here in Great Missenden and Prestwood.  The Green Party coming second in the Unitary Authority elections made that loud and clear!

I’m very proud to have been voted onto the Great Missenden Parish Council for Prestwood and Heath End Ward, and look forward to working with a great team of councillors there, focussing on what is important to residents, and also ensuring that I can support environmental and social projects to benefit the community.  I also run a local Environmental group, helping to educate local residents, and share ideas to make our live more sustainable, mitigating what is within our control in regard to Climate Change.

I look forward to the next Council Elections, and joining at Unitary Authority level next time, to be another Green voice, holding Buckinghamshire Council accountable for policy and decisions.  I’m keen to bring about accountability, ensuring that decisions are not based on social issued, the economy, or the environment.  These areas are not interdependent, and should be balanced together in all decisions.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/images/79799-89205a78-3a86-4cc8-b75b-a676e9acd238.png

I am committed to bringing meaningful change to Wycombe, starting from the grassroots level.   One of the most pressing issues in our community is the inadequate state of our Minor Illness Unit. It is not equipped to handle the growing population of Wycombe, and I will fight to ensure it receives the necessary upgrades to provide timely and effective care for all residents.   I am also a strong advocate for social justice and believe in the need to end the two-child benefit cap. This policy disproportionately affects the most vulnerable families in our community, and I will work tirelessly to see it overturned.   On a broader scale, I believe in an ethical foreign policy. By avoiding unnecessary conflicts, we can reduce the number of migrants forced to leave their homes. Peaceful diplomacy should always be our first approach, ensuring that our international actions align with our values.   Locally, I will champion for a living wage in Wycombe. Every worker deserves to earn enough to live with dignity and security. By advocating for fair wages, we can build a stronger, more resilient community where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.   Your support is crucial for these changes to become a reality. Together, we can build a better Wycombe for everyone. I humbly ask for your vote and trust in this election.

He has been a key campaigner and organiser for Trafford Liberal Democrats over the past 5 years, and has advised councillors & campaigners across Greater Manchester.

Simon's family is from Cumbria, where he was also born. He moved down to St. Albans in the 1980s after his parents' divorce, taking his stepfather's surname after his mother remarried. He went to school in the area gaining GCSEs and A-Levels before attending university in Northampton. He also attended Manchester Metropolitan University to further his education between 2011 and 2013.

His priorities are:

- building a healthcare system fit for the 21st century in Greater Manchester - refocusing policing back into communities, with well funded youth services from local councils to help stem the tide and cycle of crime and disorder - a transport system that works for Greater Manchester not against it - a housing plan that puts people first, not developers.

As your Member of Parliament, I will prioritize improving accessibility to healthcare, ensuring that everyone can access the treatments and support they need without undue delay.

Additionally, I will work to address the unique challenges posed by current trade agreements, advocating for agreements that uphold our local standards for health, environment, and animal welfare. It's essential to protect our farmers and food producers from unfair competition while promoting sustainable practices.

In Westminster, I will tirelessly champion the interests of Ynys Môn, striving for a fairer and more prosperous future for all who call our island home.",https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/static-candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/media/images/people/73133/dcee7de7-1e3a-4be2-95ea-cd28eedc718d.png

A career founded on the family restaurant business leading to pub, restaurant, and hotel multi-site management with major breweries and thence to the sustainability and energy manager role for the biggest hospitality companies. Latterly in the team working on energy policy development in the House of Lords. Throughout always with the understanding that people are the core of all we do.

Belief in a truly fair society made it clear to me that only the Green Party has the ideas to move us forward in the right way for all.

You might think that the Green Party is all about climate change and catastrophe, and yes, our Green New Deal is at the heart of our vision, but it goes far beyond just “going green”. We have a plan for unlocking education, restoring NHS access, tackling discrimination. We want to deliver secure incomes and secure homes for the people on this island. Fight for a better deal for Wales. We also value nature and the environment, so want to protect Ynys Mon along with it’s valuable UNESCO Global GeoPark status.

I am not just your Green parliamentary candidate but will be your ally, your voice and your advocate. My background is in business and in community building, so I understand the importance of business and how it can best serve communities. But most of all I want to listen to your concerns, your aspirations, and your ideas, to represent your needs and bring about a better Ynys Môn,

Together we can create a greener and fairer Ynys Môn, where opportunities exist for all its people.
