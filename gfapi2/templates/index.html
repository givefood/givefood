     <h2>API</h2>
      <p>We maintain the largest public database of UK food banks, and the items they are requesting to have donated.</p>
      <p>This service allows to to get access to this data over HTTPS in JSON, GeoJSON, XML or YAML.</p>
      <p>Our API and data has been used by governments, councils, supermarkets, hundreds of national &amp; local news websites, apps &amp; the Trussell Trust.</p>

      <h3>Rules</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Do good</em> with the data.</li>
        <li>Try not to make HTTP requests to us more than a few times a second.</li>
        <li>If you display a food bank's details then also, if possible, link to them.</li>
        <li>Lists of items requested should be regarded as a hint rather than perscriptive definition of what's required. If you display what a food bank needs donating, if possible, link to their shopping list URL. There is often nuance to their request.</li>
        <li>Don't modify lists of items needed.</li>
        <li>Credit us with a link to our homepage if you republish.</li>
        <li>Cache, but don't cache for too long. All this is updated at least every few hours.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Assumptions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We define a food bank as the organisation.</li>
        <li>A food bank has one or more locations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Contact</h3>
      <p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:mail@givefood.org.uk">mail@givefood.org.uk</a> if you're going to launch something using our data. We'll be more than happy to help with any technical questions &amp; optimisations, PR and to ensure that we're all helping food banks as effectively as possible.</p>
